      <!--<h2 class="title">William Blake Archive Update</h2>-->
      <p>2 June 1999</p>
      
      
      <p>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of new
        electronic editions for two works in Blake's emblem series: <i>For Children:
          The Gates of Paradise</i> and the revised and augmented version <i>For the
            Sexes: The Gates of Paradise</i>. Through a numbered series of intaglio
        plates with inscriptions ranging from single words to brief aphorisms, Blake
        puts the course of human life from birth to death in psychological
        perspective. Some of the emblems form narrative sequences; others exemplify
        mental states and their reification in the external world. Blake etched in
        intaglio the eighteen plates of <i>For Children</i> in 1793 and printed all
        extant copies (A-E) in the same year. The copy published in the Archive is
        copy D, from the Rosenwald Collection, Library of Congress.</p>
      
      
      <p>In about 1820, Blake revised <i>For Children: The Gates of Paradise</i>,
        giving the work a new title, <i>For the Sexes: The Gates of Paradise</i>,
        reworking the design plates at least twice, and adding three new text plates
        at the end (19-21). Plates 19-20 contain brief interpretive statements keyed
        by number to the preceding design plates. The final plate is addressed to
        Satan as the "God of This [fallen] World." Copies A and B were probably
        printed c. 1820. Copies C and D, plus a large group of impressions never
        collated into complete copies by Blake but now divided into what are
        designated as copies J-N, date from c. 1825. Copies E-I are probably
        posthumous. We now publish copy D, from the collection of the Pierpont Morgan
        Library, New York.</p>
      
      
      <p>Both electronic editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and new
        images scanned and color-corrected from first-generation 4x5" transparencies;
        they are each fully searchable for both text and images and supported by the
        Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates.</p>
      
      
      <p>With the publication of these two titles, the Archive now contains 33
        copies of 18 separate books, including at least one copy of every one of
        Blake's works in illuminated printing except the 100 plates of
        <i>Jerusalem</i> (forthcoming).</p>
      
      
      <p>Also, we are pleased to announce that a <a href="about/tour/index.html">Tour of the
        Archive</a> is now available online. Through a sequence of several dozen
        graphical screenshots linked to narrative commentary, the Tour introduces
        users to the basic organization and structure of the Archive, the features of
        its interface, its search options, and the function of the Inote and
        ImageSizer applications. The Tour is located in the "About the Archive" wing
        of the site. Available as the first link off our main table of contents page
        at the URL above, the "About the Archive" materials include, in addition to
        the Tour, a statement of Editorial Principles and Methodology, a Frequently
        Asked Questions list, a Technical Summary, and an updated version of the
        article-length Plan of the Archive detailing our intentions with regard to
        Blake's non-illuminated works--and more. We hope that the Tour, together with
        these other materials, will prove valuable both to our own growing user
        community and to scholars interested in the theory and practice of electronic
        editing more generally.</p>
