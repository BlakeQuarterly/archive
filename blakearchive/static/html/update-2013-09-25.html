               The William Blake Archive <www.blakearchive.org> is pleased to announce the publication of electronic editions of <a href="/blake/work/thel" target="blank"><i>The Book of Thel</i> copies B and I</a>, in the Mellon Collection, Yale Center for British Art, and Bodleian Library, Oxford University, respectively. <i>The Book of Thel</i> is dated 1789 by Blake on the title page, but the first plate (Thel's Motto) and the last (her descent into the netherworld) appear to have been completed and first printed in 1790, while Blake was working on <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i>.   
                 <p>
                   Copies B and I are from the first of three printings of <i>Thel</i>, during which Blake produced at least thirteen copies, printed in five different inks to diversify his stock. Copy B, for example, was printed in brown ink, copy I in green; both are lightly finished in water colors. Copies from this press run were certainly on hand when Blake included the book in his advertisement "To the Public" of October 1793: "The Book of Thel, a Poem in Illuminated Printing. Quarto, with 6 designs, price 3s." Copies B and I join in the Archive copies D, G, H, J, L, and R from this first printing, and copy F, printed and colored c. 1795, and copy O, printed and colored c. 1818.        
                   <p>
                     With the publication of <i>Thel</i> copies B and I, the Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of 89 copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated books in the context of full bibliographic information about each work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and extensive bibliographies. New protocols for transcription, which produce improved accuracy and fuller documentation in editors' notes, have been applied to all copies of <i>Thel</i> in the Archive. With the Archive's Compare feature, users can easily juxtapose multiple impressions of any plate across all or selected copies of this or any of the other illuminated books and, with the Virtual Lightbox, users can examine images from any genre side by side, as well as crop, zoom, and juxtapose them for close study.
                     <p>
                       In addition to illuminated books, the Archive contains many important manuscripts and series of engravings, color printed drawings, tempera paintings, and water color drawings, including <a href="/blake/work/but335" target="blank">illustrations to Thomas Gray's <i>Poems</i></a>, <a href="/blake/work/but812" target="blank">water color</a> and <a href="/blake/work/bb448" target="blank">engraved</a> illustrations to Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i>, <a href="/blake/work/cpd" target="blank">the large color printed drawings of 1795 and c. 1805</a>, the <a href="/blake/work/but551" target="blank">Linnell</a> and <a href="/blake/work/but550" target="blank">Butts</a> sets of the <i>Book of Job</i> water colors and the <a href="/blake/work/but557" target="blank">sketchbook</a> containing drawings for the engraved illustrations to the <i>Book of Job</i>, the water color <a href="/blake/work/butwba10" target="blank">illustrations to Robert Blair's <i>The Grave</i></a>, and all nine of Blake's water color series illustrating the poetry of John Milton, such as the <a href="/blake/work/but537" target="blank">Linnell</a>, <a href="/blake/work/but536" target="blank">Butts</a>, and <a href="/blake/work/but529" target="blank">Thomas</a> sets of the illustrations to <i>Paradise Lost</i>.                    
                       <p>
                         As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the University of Rochester, the continuing support of the Library of Congress, and the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.
