      <h2 class="title">What's New in the William Blake Archive</h2>
      22 November, 2006
      <P>
        The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce   
        the publication of an electronic edition of Blake's water color 
        illustrations for Robert Blair's <i>The Grave</i>.  These are probably the 20  
        designs selected in 1805 by R. H. Cromek for publication in his 
        forthcoming edition of <i>The Grave</i>, although only 12 were engraved by 
        Louis Schiavonetti for the volume, published in 1808.  One design, <i>The   
          Widow Embracing her Husband's Grave</i>, has been known for many years, but  
        the other 19 water colors disappeared between their auction in 1836 and   
        their dramatic rediscovery in 2001.  These 19 were sold individually at   
        auction in spring 2006 and are now widely dispersed.  The Grave water 
        colors are presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the 
        features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (our image 
        annotation program).  They join Schiavonetti's engravings and Blake's 
        white-line etching of one design, "Deaths Door," previously published in  
        the Archive.
        <P>
          As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access   
          restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible
          through the continuing support of the Library of Congress, the Institute  
          for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia,  
          the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and by the cooperation of
          the international array of libraries, museums, and private collectors that
          have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their 
          collections in the Archive.
