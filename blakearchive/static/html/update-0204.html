      <p>1 February 2004</p>
      
      
      <p>The William Blake Archive <!--www.blakearchive.org--> is pleased to
        announce the publication of "Illuminated Printing." It joins our profusely
        illustrated Biography, Chronology, and Glossary in the About Blake section,
        off the Table of Contents page. The essay was first published in <i>The
          Cambridge Companion to William Blake</i>, edited by Morris Eaves, 2003. It is
        republished here by permission of Cambridge University Press. While the text
        remains the same, the electronic version has 95 illustrations versus 9 in the
        printed version. The illustrations demonstrate in detail the stages of both
        Blake's relief etching ("illuminated printing") and conventional intaglio
        etching according to the six Chambers in the Printing house in Hell, from
        Blake's <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i>. The comparison of these two
        methods of etching will help reveal what was borrowed, altered, invented, and
        radical in Blake's new mode of graphic production. The illustrations, which
        are linked to enlargements that have detailed captions, supplement the text
        but also function autonomously as slide shows on the technical and aesthetic
        contexts in which illuminated printing was invented, and as tutorials in the
        production of engravings, etchings, and relief etchings.</p>
      
      
      <p>As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
        restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible
        through the continuing support of the Library of Congress, the Institute for
        Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a
        major grant from the Preservation and Access Division of the National
        Endowment for the Humanities, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel
        Hill, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries and
        museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from
        their collections in the Archive.</p>
