browser/platform/system for accessing the Archive?</p>





      
      
      
      
      <blockquote> The Blake Archive will function well with all
up-to-date versions of major computer operating systems and Web
browsers. We recommend that you use the latest version of Java 6, which
can be downloaded <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/faq/java_6.xml" target="blank">here</a>. If you are using Java 7 and are encountering security-related problems when attempting to use the Lightbox application, follow Java's suggested "Workaround" <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_blocked.xml" target="blank">here</a>.
      </blockquote>





      
      
      
      
      <p class="c3">I've encountered a technical problem
(bug) that seems to be impeding my use of the Archive. Can you help?</p>





      
      
      
      
      <blockquote> We maintain a list of known bugs and hazards,
available <a href="../../../help/hazards.html" target="blank">here</a>,
which you should consult to see if we have already documented the
problem you are having, and perhaps offered a solution. If not, we
welcome bug reports. Please mail them to <a href="mailto:williamblakearchive@gmail.com">williamblakearchive@gmail.com</a>
and be sure to indicate the day and time you were accessing the
Archive, as well as information about your browser (type and version)
and operating system. </blockquote>





      
      
      
      
      <p class="c3">I'm stuck with a slow connection to
the Internet; is there any way to improve download times?</p>





      
      
      
      
      <blockquote> Unfortunately, all we can recommend is that
you opt for the non-Java version of the site; a link for the non-Java
option is located on all "Index" and "Object View" pages in the
Archive. We regret the large file sizes of our inline and enlarged
images, but believe the large file sizes are justified by the need to
capture enough high-resolution detail from the original artifact for
the digital image to be a suitable basis for serious study and
scholarship. </blockquote>





      
      
      
      
      <p class="c3">Aren't there already dozens of Blake
sites out there? What's special about this one?</p>





      
      
      
      
      <blockquote> In brief, we believe the Archive is
distinguished by the <a href="../editors/index.html" target="blank">scholarly
expertise</a> of its editors, the <a href="/blake/indexworks.htm" target="blank">breadth of its holdings</a>
(and the diversity of the <a href="../../institutions.html" target="blank">libraries,
museums, and private collectors</a> generously contributing
them), and the very carefully chosen <a href="../tech/index.html" target="blank">technical
standards</a> and <a href="../principles/index.html" target="blank">editorial
principles</a>
with which its texts and images are being
prepared. All of this&mdash;combined with structured data and
sophisticated information-retrieval technologies&mdash;allows us to
organize and assemble the Archive's materials in ways that would have
been impossible prior to the advent of functional hypermedia systems.
The Archive also functions as a testbed for a suite of advanced
image-manipulation tools that may well prove instrumental in carrying
out
other large image-based electronic editing projects. </blockquote>





      
      
      
      
      <p class="c3">Is it OK to use the Archive's images
on my own personal Web pages either for decoration or for educational
or other non-commercial purposes? After all, that's not really the same
as "republishing" them, is it?</p>





      
      
      
      
      <blockquote> On the contrary, it is the same as
republishing them and you may not use the Archive's images on your own
Web pages without first obtaining the necessary permissions. Making an
image (or content of any kind) available on the Web (even for
recreational, educational, or other non-profit use) has been legally
interpreted as publication, and publication requires the express prior
consent of the copyright owner. </blockquote>





      
      
      
      
      <blockquote> The copying of materials from the Blake
Archive is permitted only under the <a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/" target="blank">fair use</a>
provisions of U.S. copyright law. </blockquote>





      
      
      
      
      <p class="c3">But if your images are publicly
accessible online in the first place, doesn't that place them in the
public domain?</p>





      
      
      
      
      <blockquote> No. Publicly accessible is not the same thing
as public domain. Public domain is a legal term, meaning that a given
work does not qualify for protection under the conventions of copyright
law. In fact, lots of material that is publicly <i>accessible</i>
on the Web&mdash;or in print&mdash;is not in the public domain.
That is why
books that reproduce illustrations will often contain notices of
permissions received from the copyright owner. Even though the
reproduction of the image is being made publicly <i>accessible</i>
in the book, the author or publisher still needed to secure permission
to use it in the first place. Just so with the Blake Archive's images
on the Web: we have sought and been granted permission to reproduce all
of the images in the Archive and make them available to the general
public as part of our online collections, but this does not mean that
the images have been granted public domain status or that the owners of
the originals have relinquished their claims to copyright. </blockquote>





      
      
      
      
      <p class="c3">You've got some nerve trying to
dictate what I can and can't put on my own pages. Do you think Blake
would have wanted to see his work smothered by copyright laws? Why
can't you just look the other way?</p>





      
      
      
      
      <blockquote> Because the continued growth and development
of the Archive depends on the goodwill of the museums and libraries
that own the originals of Blake's work. If unauthorized use of our
images becomes a chronic problem, there is the real possibility that
one or more of these institutions will refuse to work with us in the
future, thus undermining the usefulness of our collections to everyone.
Moreover, we update and emend our texts and images on a continual
basis, and we want the most recent versions of the Archive's materials
to be the ones generally available; it is not in our interest or the
interest of our users to have isolated fragments of the Archive in
circulation elsewhere on the Web. </blockquote>





      
      
      
      
      <blockquote> The Blake Archive is a free site, open to all;
we impose no subscription fees or access restrictions. We are
endeavoring to create a resource of the highest standards and integrity
for use by scholars, students, and the general public. If you care
about a legacy for Blake in cyberspace, please respect our wishes in
this matter. </blockquote>





      
      
      
      
      <p class="c3">How do I know who owns the copyright
on a given image? How do I go about contacting the owner? And what
about permissions to reuse the Archive's <u>texts</u>?</p>





      
      
      
      
      <blockquote> Click on the &copy; symbol at the bottom
left under each image in the Archive to find out which institution or
individual owns its copyright. Contact information for institutions and
individuals is available from our <a href="../../institutions.html" target="blank">Contributing
Collections</a> page. In most cases, permission must be obtained
from the owning institution. We can only grant permission to reproduce
Archive materials; please do not contact us regarding materials not
present in the Archive. </blockquote>





      
      
      
      
      <blockquote> To obtain the right to reuse an <b>image</b> or&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">text</span> (transcription) in the Archive (except for Erdman's <cite>Complete
Poetry and Prose of William Blake</cite>), please follow these&nbsp;<a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/public/permission_form/request_permission.html" target="_new">instructions</a>. </blockquote>


      
      
      <p class="c3">Why are some of the images copyrighted
to the William Blake Archive? I thought you said the owner of the
original always retains the copyright. And doesn't the Library of
Congress have a special copyright policy?</p>





      
      
      
      
      <blockquote> When the owning institution opts not to claim
copyright, the Archive's editors retain copyright instead. For example,
the copyright declaration for the Library of Congress states: "The
Library of Congress neither grants nor denies permission to reproduce
materials from its collections. When material from our collections are
reproduced in a book or other media, we ask, as a courtesy, that
somewhere in the item there be a indication that the original is in the
Rare Book and Special Collection Division, Library of Congress."
        
        
        
        
        <p>Note, however, that this policy does not extend to
reproductions of Library of Congress materials created by a third party
(such as the William Blake Archive). The Archive's editors therefore
claim copyright over their digital images of Library of Congress
materials, images that they have created from their own (considerable)
expenditures of time and money. Users wishing to reproduce Library of
Congress images may not do so without the express permission of the
Archive's editors. Likewise, copyright on materials from the Essick
Collection is also retained by the Archive's editors.</p>





        
        
        
        
            <p>The editors may be contacted at <a href="mailto:williamblakearchive@gmail.com">williamblakearchive@gmail.com</a>.</p>

certain work] to hang on my wall. Do you know where can I find it?</p>





      
      
      
      
      <blockquote> If you are interested in a print (or a
postcard or a T-shirt) with a particular Blake image, it would be best
to contact the owner of the work and inquire about reproductions of the
type you wish to acquire. Contact information for the institutions
contributing works to the Archive can be found on our <a href="../../institutions.html" target="blank">Contributing Collections</a>
page; many of these institutions also have gift shops which are linked
from their home page. </blockquote>





      
      
      
      
      <p class="c3">Is [a certain work] in the Archive yet?</p>





      
      
      
      
      <blockquote> The best way to tell at the moment is simply
to select <a href="/blake/indexworks.htm" target="blank">Works in the
Archive</a>
from our main table of contents page, and examine the
materials you find linked there. If the item you want has text
("tyger," "tiger," "prisons") or image content ("queen," "nose,"
"mane") that you can specify, our <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/search.html" target="blank">text- and image-search tools</a> may help narrow your search considerably. In the future we will be adding a
search feature that will function as an index of titles in the Archive.

you may wish to consult our <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/resources.html" target="blank">General and Specific
Bibliographies</a>, which you'll find linked from our main table

our permission to link to the Archive, or to individual items within
the Archive.&nbsp;</blockquote>


      
      
      <p class="c3">What's the best way to learn to use
the Archive to its full potential?</p>





        
        
      
      
      <blockquote> By reading our help documentation, available

      <p class="c3">Is there a quicker way?</p>





        
        
      
      
      <blockquote> Even a close reading of the help
documentation shouldn't take more than about thirty minutes, and we
think most long-term users of the Archive will judge the time well
spent. But if you're in a hurry you might either examine our <a href="../../../help/help.html" target="blank">graphical help screens</a>,

      <blockquote> In one important sense "never," given the
openended nature of electronic publishing. The Archive is meant to be
an organic resource, continually expanding and developing to support
the needs of scholars studying Blake for a great many years to come.
Having achieved the goal of incorporating copies of all of Blake's
illuminated books, the archive has moved into a new phase, focused on
the non-illuminated works, such as watercolor drawings, engravings,
manuscripts, and printed books, though we regularly publish editions of
additional copies of the illuminated books as well. A detailed
timetable of our goals and
accomplishments is available in the <a href="../plan/index.html" target="blank">Plan
