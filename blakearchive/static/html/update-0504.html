      <p>25 May 2004</p>
      
      
      <p>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of
        electronic editions of <i>The Song of Los</i>, copies A and D. Both have been
        in the collection of the British Museum since the mid-nineteenth century;
        they join copy B from the Library of Congress, previously published in the
        Archive. Like all six extant copies of <i>The Song of Los</i>, A and D were
        richly color printed in 1795. With its divisions into sections titled
        "Africa" and "Asia," <i>The Song of Los</i> follows <i>America</i> (1793) and
        Europe (1794) as the last of Blake's "Continental Prophecies" that mingle
        contemporary events with a host of mythological motifs, both borrowed and
        invented.</p>
      
      
      <p>As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
        restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible
        through the continuing support of the Library of Congress, the Institute for
        Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a
        major grant from the Preservation and Access Division of the National
        Endowment for the Humanities, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel
        Hill, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries and
        museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from
        their collections in the Archive.</p>
