      <!--<h2 class="title">William Blake Archive Update</h2>-->
      <p>9 March 1999</p>
      
      
      <p>The editors of the William Blake Archive are pleased to announce the
        publication of three new electronic editions of Blake's most popular work,
        <i>Songs of Innocence and of Experience</i>. They are of copies C, F, and
        L--none has been reproduced before now.</p>
      
      
      <p><i>Songs</i> copy C is one of the first copies of the combined
        <i>Songs</i>. Along with copies B, D, and E, it was formed in 1794 of
        <i>Innocence</i> plates printed in raw sienna on both sides of the leaf in
        1789 and <i>Experience</i> plates lightly color printed in yellow ochre in
        the same format in 1794. By this time, Blake had decided to move plates 34-36
        ("The Little Girl Lost" and "The Little Girl Found") to <i>Experience</i>,
        but since plate 34 was printed on the verso of the leaf with plate 26 ("A
        Dream"), plate 26 is read in this copy, as well as in copies B and D, as an
        <i>Experience</i> poem. And, like copies B and D, copy C is missing plate 52
        ("To Tirzah") but has the small vignette known as plate a (five cherubs
        carrying a naked figure), one of Blake's earliest relief etchings used here
        as a tailpiece. Copy C is in the Rosenwald Collection, Library of
        Congress.</p>
      
      
      <p>Bibliographically, copy F is even more interesting. It, too, consists of
        two sections printed differently and at different times. Its <i>Innocence</i>
        plates were printed in green ink on both sides of the leaf in 1789, probably
        before the raw sienna printing. Its <i>Experience</i> plates were heavily
        color printed on one side of the leaf in 1794, before those in copy C,
        possibly while <i>Experience</i> was still in progress. The impressions of
        <i>Experience</i> were printed with those now in <i>Songs</i> copies G, H,
        and T, which are all missing plates 39, 44, 45, and 48. Together, these four
        plates form one sheet of copper. The fact that all four plates are missing
        from all four copies suggests that the plates were not yet part of
        <i>Experience</i> at the time of this printing. These four color-printed
        copies of <i>Experience</i> appear to have been intended as autonomous
        publications. At any rate, there are no extant sets of <i>Innocence</i>
        impressions printed in this style, copies G and H remain without
        <i>Innocence</i>, and copies F and T were assembled by someone other than
        Blake.</p>
      
      
      <p><i>Songs</i> copy L, like copy F, is in the Yale Center for British Art.
        Unlike copies C and F, though, its two parts were printed together in a
        uniform style, dark brown ink on one side of the leaf, ca. 1795. It has all
        54 plates, including plate 52, that make up the combined <i>Songs</i> and is
        numbered by Blake 1-54.</p>
      
      
      <p>All of these editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and all are
        fully searchable for both text and images and supported by the unique Inote
        and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates. We now have
        twenty-nine copies of sixteen illuminated books in the Archive. We will soon
        be adding two more copies of <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i> and an
        in-depth illustrated Tour highlighting the Archive's features and some ways
        to use its resources. We will continue to add new electronic editions of
        illuminated books throughout the spring and summer.</p>
