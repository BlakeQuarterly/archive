      <p><b>Morris Eaves</b> is co-editor (with
Morton Paley, University of California, Berkeley) of <cite>Blake/An
Illustrated Quarterly</cite>. In <cite>The Counter-Arts
Conspiracy: Art and Industry in the Age of Blake</cite>, and
subsequent essays, he has explored Blake's theories of art in their
historical contexts, including the histories of visual art, commerce,
and technology. His current project, <cite>Posterity</cite>,
is a speculative study of editorial theory and practice in terms of the
audience's historical power to preserve, alter, and abandon its objects
of interest. </p>

      <p><b>Robert N. Essick</b>, a major collector
of Blake's work, has spent much of his career expanding and correcting
the knowledge of Blake as an artist. <cite>William Blake
Printmaker</cite> was the first reliable and comprehensive
account of a fundamental but neglected dimension of Blake's career.
Subsequent writings, such as Essick's catalogues raisonnes of Blake's
separate plates and commercial engravings, have been models of their
kind, not only accurate and complete but also well-informed by the
critical and analytical methods of contemporary art history. </p>

      <p><b>Joseph Viscomi's</b> experience as a
printmaker and curator served him well in <cite>Blake and the
Idea of the Book</cite>, a study of the production, editing, and
dating of the illuminated books that overturned much of the
conventional wisdom about Blake's illuminated-book medium. The second
volume of this project, <cite>The Caves of Heaven and Hell:
Reading the Illuminated Books</cite>, is now in progress. Other
writings on Blake include studies on the evolution of <cite>The
Marriage of Heaven and Hell</cite> and on Blake's market and
reputation in the mid-nineteenth century.
      </p>

      <p>Eaves, Essick, and Viscomi worked together on two
volumes of the six-volume Blake Trust edition of Blake's illuminated
books.
