      <!--<h2 class="title">What's New in the William Blake Archive</h2>-->
      <p>
      11 October 2006
      <P>
        The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce 
        the publication of an electronic edition of <i>The [First] Book of Urizen</i>
        copy D (British Museum).
        <P>
          Blake etched in shallow relief the 28 plates of <i>The [First] Book of
            Urizen</i> in 1794, although only copies A and B contain them all.  Copy D,
          with 26 plates, was beautifully and extensively color printed in 1794,  
          along with copies A, C, E, F, and J. Copy D is the sixth of eight extant
          copies to enter the Archive, joining copies A, B (1795), C, F, and G
          (1818). Like these and all the illuminated books in the Archive, its text
          and images are fully searchable and are supported by our Inote and
          ImageSizer applications. With the Archive's Compare feature, users can 
          easily juxtapose multiple impressions of any plate across the different
          copies of this or any of the other illuminated book. New protocols for
          transcription, which produce improved accuracy and fuller documentation in
          editors' notes, have been applied to copy D and to all the <i>Urizen</i> texts
          previously published.
          <P>
            With the publication of <i>Urizen</i> copy D, the Archive now contains fully 
            searchable and scalable electronic editions of 55 copies of Blake's 19  
            illuminated books in the context of full bibliographic information about
            each work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed
            descriptions of all images, and extensive bibliographies. In addition to
            illuminated books, the Archive contains many important series of
            engravings, sketches, and watercolor drawings, including <i>Illustrations to
              Thomas Gray's Poems</i>, <i>Water Color and Engraved Illustrations to Dante's 
                Divine Comedy</i>, The Large Color Printed Drawings of 1795 and c. 1805, and 
            the recently published Linnell set of <i>Book of Job</i> water colors and the  
            <i>Sketchbook Containing Drawings for the Engraved Illustrations to the Book
              of Job</i>.
            <P>
              As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access  
              restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible
              through the continuing support of the Library of Congress, the Institute  
              for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia,  
              by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and by the cooperation
              of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously
              given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the
              Archive.
