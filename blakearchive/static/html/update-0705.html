      <!--<h2 class="title">What's New in the William Blake Archive</h2>-->
      18 July 2005
      
      <p>The William Blake Archive <!--www.blakearchive.org--> is pleased to announce the publication of redesigned and updated bibliographies and collection lists.  This redesigned section of the site allows easy access to information about William Blake, his works, and Blake holdings in major collections.
        
        <p> The General Bibliography is divided into four sections: basic reference works; standard editions; literary, historical, and biographical studies; and art historical studies. The Specific Bibliography is divided into sections according to media, and each section is further subdivided down to the level of the individual work. Together, these lists provide a comprehensive resource on major articles and books on Blake published in English.
          
          <p>The Collection Lists catalogue original works by Blake owned by institutions and collectors that have allowed their holdings to be included in the Archive. Each list is organized by media and genres.  Complete lists of holdings from the following institutions and private collectors are included:
