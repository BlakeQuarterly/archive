                The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of a digital edition of Blake’s <a href="work/bb49" target="_blank"><i>French Revolution</i></a>.

                <i>The French Revolution</i> (1791) is the only one of Blake’s works of poetry ever slated for conventional publication—and by England’s most prominent publisher of reformers and radicals, Joseph Johnson, whose authors included, among others, Erasmus Darwin, Mary Wollstonecraft, William Godwin, Joseph Priestley, and Thomas Malthus. But Blake’s poem falls into a sadly familiar pattern in his artistic life: promises made, projects curtailed or cancelled, hopes dashed. <i>The French Revolution, A Poem. In Seven Books. Book the First</i> is followed by an optimistic “Advertisement / The remaining Books of this Poem are finished and will be published in their Order.” If books 2-7 did exist, they never progressed beyond a manuscript now lost, any more than the great illuminated book <a href="work/milton" target="_blank"><i>Milton / a Poem in [1]2 Books</i></a> ever got beyond its first two.

                Only one copy of <i>The French Revolution</i> exists, apparently page proofs (set in type and arranged in pages for final stages of proofreading before publication). Blake’s name does not appear. “Wm Blake” is inserted in an unknown hand in the customary space for authors’ names. The original anonymity was perhaps an error but more likely a consequence of the same reticence to be identified with overtly radical sentiments that Blake showed on other occasions—in 1790, <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i> (closing with the chorus of “A Song of Liberty”), is the only illuminated book neither signed nor dated. If <i>The French Revolution</i> was withdrawn from publication, why? Johnson withdrew Thomas Paine’s <i>Rights of Man</i> the same year; perhaps he abandoned Blake’s poem for similar reasons. Concern would not have been entirely misplaced: in 1799 Johnson spent six months in prison for seditious libel.

                Blake eventually gave, or sold, the page proofs of <i>The French Revolution Book the First</i> to his friend and patron John Linnell. A posthumous excerpt almost made it into W. M. Rossetti’s selections from Blake’s work for the 1880 edition of Gilchrist’s <i>Life of Blake</i>—but not quite. Not until 1913 was Blake’s poem finally published, in the second edition of John Sampson’s <i>Poetical Works of William Blake</i>, well over a century after its original retraction.

                Its date and subject mark <i>The French Revolution</i> as an attempted poetic contribution to the fierce Revolution Controversy, associated especially with Richard Price’s sermon and pamphlet, “Discourse on the Love of Our Country” (1789), Edmund Burke’s widely read Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), Mary Wollstonecraft’s Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790), and Paine’s Rights of Man (1791, also printed for Johnson but published by someone less cautious).

                In his edition, Erdman places <i>The French Revolution</i> in the category of Prophetic Works, Unengraved. “Prophetic” puts it where it belongs, with early works such as <a href="work/bb203" target="_blank"><i>Tiriel</i></a> (1789), <a href="work/thel" target="_blank"><i>The Book of Thel</i></a> (1789), and <a href="work/mhh" target="_blank"><i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i></a> (1790)—all experiments in mythmaking whose tone and meaning can be so elusive. <i>The French Revolution</i> is the most explicitly historical of the early group—with characters (Fayette, the King), settings (the Bastille, Versailles), and plot elements transplanted from the daily news into mythic narrative that portends apocalyptic change:

                Historically, the plot compresses the earliest stage of the revolution—May to July 1789—into a single hypercharged sequence, from dawn to dawn, with suggestions of psychomachia, a psychological struggle against a radical change of mind. For his mode of telling, Blake searches again—as he had in <i>Tiriel</i> and <i>Thel</i>—for a poetic line capable of containing such volatile elements. The meter of <i>The French Revolution</i> has been characterized as “a consistently anapestic roll” (Frye, Fearful Symmetry page 185) and “anapestic-iambic septenary” (Damon, Blake Dictionary page 146), but it may be more helpful to hear it in the broad context of experiments in the long heroic line that start with Tiriel and Thel and culminate in the encyclopedic mythopoeia of <i>The Four Zoas</i>, <i>Milton</i>, and <i>Jerusalem</i>.
