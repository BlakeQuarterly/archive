      <h2 class="title">William Blake Archive Update</h2>
      <p>5 March 2001</p>
      
      
      <p>The William Blake Archive www.blakearchive.org is pleased to announce the
        publication of new electronic editions of <cite>America a Prophecy</cite>
        copy O and <cite>Europe a Prophecy</cite> copy K.</p>
      
      
      <p><cite>America</cite> copy O and <cite>Europe</cite> copy K are both in the
        Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, England. They join copies of
        <cite>America</cite> and <cite>Europe</cite> in the Archive from other
        printings: <cite>America</cite> copies E (1793) and A (1795), and
        <cite>Europe</cite> copies B (1794) and E (1794). Copy M of
        <cite>America</cite>, from a c. 1807 printing, and copy H of
        <cite>Europe</cite> (a unique monochrome copy) from a 1795 printing, are
        forthcoming.</p>
      
      
      <p>The electronic editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and new
        images scanned and color-corrected from first-generation 4x5" transparencies;
        text and images are each fully searchable and supported by the Inote and
        ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates.</p>
      
      
      <p>With the publication of these two titles, the Archive now contains fully
        searchable and scalable electronic editions of 43 copies of 18 of Blake's 19
        illuminated books in the context of full bibliographic information about each
        work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions
        of all images, and extensive bibliographies. They also join our searchable
        SGML-encoded electronic edition of David V. Erdman's <cite>Complete Poetry
          and Prose of William Blake</cite>. With the forthcoming publication of
        <cite>Jerusalem</cite> copy E, the Archive will contain at least one copy of
        each of Blake's works in illuminated printing and multiple copies of
        most.</p>
      
      
      <p><cite>America</cite> copy O is one of fourteen extant copies of
        <cite>America</cite> printed by Blake, one of four colored copies, one of two
        with the full text of plate 4, one of four without plate e ["Preludium"], and
        the only copy printed after c. 1807. <cite>Europe</cite>copy K is one of nine
        extant copies printed by Blake, one of only two copies with plate 3 ["Five
        windows light the cavern'd Man"], and the only copy printed after 1795. They
        are extraordinarily beautiful copies, with each impression bordered by one
        thin line drawn in red ink a few centimeters outside the edge of the image,
        setting off each page like a miniature painting.</p>
      
      
      <p>Produced together in 1821 for the painter John Linnell, Blake's young
        patron, they were printed in orangish-red ink on one side of J. Whatman paper
        dated 1818, 1819, and 1820, numbered 1-18, and finished in gold, watercolors,
        and pen and ink in the same style Blake used in c. 1818 and 1821-22, and
        1825-27. Works from these sessions include <cite>The Book of Thel</cite> copy
        O, <cite>Urizen</cite> copy G, <cite>Songs of Innocence and of
          Experience</cite> copies Z and AA, and <cite>The Marriage of Heaven and
            Hell</cite> copy I, which are in the Archive, and <cite>Jerusalem</cite> copy
        E, <cite>Visions of the Daughters of Albion</cite> copy P,
        <cite>Milton</cite> copy D, and <cite>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</cite>
        copy G, each of which will soon enter the Archive.</p>
