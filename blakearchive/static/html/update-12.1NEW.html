      <h2 class="title">William Blake Archive Update</h2>
      <p>3 December 2001</p>
      
      
      <p>The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the Archive's first
        mirror site. Hosted at Oxford University in Oxford, England, the mirror is
        available at www.blakearchive.org.uk. The Archive averages 1,600+ visits per
        day, and many of these "visits" originate from British domains. Intended to
        improve access speed for our British and European users, the mirror can be
        accessed from our welcome and index pages as well as at the URL listed above.
        All Archive materials are available at both sites.</p>
      
      
      <p>The Humanities Computing Unit (HCU), a division of the Oxford University
        Computing Services (OUCS), hosts this mirror. The Blake mirror is the second
        such partnership between the Institute for Advanced Technology in the
        Humanities (IATH) and the HCU. The Archive joins a growing list of Web-based
        humanities research projects that target and reach a global audience. A
        second Blake mirror in the Pacific is also in the works.</p>
      
      
      <p>We would like to thank Conall O'Brien (Systems Administrator, Network
        Systems Management Service, OUCS), Kirk Hastings (Lead Programmer/Analyst,
        IATH), and Andrea Laue (Project Manager, William Blake Archive) for their
        efforts on this project. In addition, Lou Burnard (Manager, HCU) and John
        Unsworth (Director, IATH) should be recognized for their support.</p>
      
      
      <p>As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access
        restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible
        through the continuing support of the Institute for Advanced Technology in
        the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a major grant from the
        Preservation and Access Division of the National Endowment for the
        Humanities, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries
        and museums that have generously given us permission to represent works from
        their collections in the Archive.</p>
      
      
      <p>At present the Archive contains 41 copies of 18 of Blake's 19 illuminated
        books, plus a fully SGML-encoded electronic edition of David. V. Erdman's
        <i>Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</i>. In the near future we
        expect to release a much-anticipated electronic edition of <i>Jerusalem</i>,
        copy E; the publication of Blake's longest (and perhaps most spectacular)
        work will render the Archive's illuminated collection complete, with at least
        one copy of every work and multiple copies of most. At that point, in
        addition to continuing to publish additional copies of the works in
        illuminated printing, we will begin to incorporate Blake's accomplishments in
        other media (paintings, drawings, commercial and original engravings, and
        manuscripts). By spring we also plan to publish collection handlists for each
        of the Archive's contributing institutions. Future supplementary materials
        include a biography and glossary as well as improved, searchable versions of
        our bibliographies.</p>
