      <!--<h2 class="title">What's New in the William Blake Archive</h2>-->
      <p>
      14 February 2007
      <P>
        The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce the publication of an electronic edition of two copies--one uncolored and one 
        hand colored--of Blake's engraved illustrations to Edward Young's <i>Night Thoughts</i> (1797).  Both 
        copies are presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (our 
        image annotation program).  
        <P>
          With what must have been enormous energy, Blake executed 537 water colors illustrating the poem's nine sections, which Young 
          called "Nights," for the publisher Richard Edwards.  The 1797 volume included a selection of illustrations for the first four 
          Nights, but Edwards closed his publishing business before any further volumes could be issued.  Many copies include a two-page 
          "Explanation of the Engravings," possibly written by Blake's friend and fellow-artist Henry Fuseli.  The texts of these 
          commentaries are included in the Editor's Notes for each plate.
          <P>
            The colorist(s) of the twenty-seven traced colored copies have never been convincingly identified.  The copy now published in the 
            Archive, from the Huntington Library, was very probably colored shortly after publication.
            <P>
              As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site 
              is made possible through the continuing support of the Library of Congress, the Institute for Advanced Technology in the 
              Humanities at the University of Virginia, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and by the cooperation of the 
              international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in 
              the Archive.
              <P>
