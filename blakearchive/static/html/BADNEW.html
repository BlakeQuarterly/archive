        <i>In an effort to make our editorial procedures more transparent, the Archive is making available excerpts from our internal project documentation. This excerpt explains the rationale and purpose for the Blake Archive Documents (BADs) that make possible the publication of our electronic editions. This documentation has been created and maintained over time by the Archive's editors, project managers, and staff; the version included here is current as of August 2012. Users can view the XML BAD for any edition in the Archive by clicking on the link provided on the work's Electronic Edition Information page.</i>

      <b>BAD Rationale, or What's a BAD File Good For?</b></A></p>
      
      <p>
        The basic purpose of a BAD file is to organize the display of objects on the Blake Archive, including the sequencing of objects when a work is composed of more than one object (e.g., most of the illuminated books or series of engravings or water colors).  In addition, the file is meant to accomplish the following:
      </p><p>
      </p><ol>
        <li>
          
          The recording of basic information about a work, including physical properties, such as size, number of leaves, and type of support; origination of the work, such as printer and colorist and dates of composition and printing; and ownership and provenance information (<b>"copyheader"</b>).  For books, such as the illuminated books, this information may be described as bibliographic and/or chalcographic.  For works such as engravings, drawings and paintings, this information is very similar to what one finds in a standard catalogue raisonn√© of an artist's work.
          <p>
          </p></li><li>
            The transcription of all alphanumeric signs represented in a work (<b>"textual transcription"</b>).  These include both printed texts, whether letterpress or etched or engraved, and texts inscribed in pencil or pen.  These transcriptions are frequently accompanied by notes about the text or, more generally, about the object on which the text appears (e.g., the state of an engraved plate).  The textual notes generally deal with variants among exemplars of the text, unique features of the text in the exemplar at hand, or other matters common to textual notes in scholarly editions.  The transcribed texts are fully searchable.
            <p>
            </p></li><li>
              The verbal description of all pictorial images in an object (<b>"illustration description"</b>).  Although there is no such thing as an "objective" description of a picture, and all such descriptions have interpretive implications, the descriptions in a BAD file generally tend toward the "purely descriptive" rather than the "intensively interpretive" ends of the spectrum.  Thus, the descriptions concentrate on the naming of motifs (called "components" in a BAD file) rather than the interpretation of the symbolic/iconographic implications of such motifs.  For example, a description would indicate that there is a "sheep standing on the right" in a pictorial composition, but it would generally not indicate that this sheep may be a symbol of Christ.  This is not a hard and fast rule but a rule-of-thumb.  The one clearly interpretive feature of these descriptions is the identification of represented human figures, whether traditional/historical (e.g., Christ, Job) or unique to Blake's own mythology (e.g., Orc, Urizen).  Such identifications are made only when we are reasonably certain of such identifications, although alternative identifications (e.g., "this may be either Milton or Los") are permitted.
              <p>
                The verbal descriptions are divided into two types: a general description of
                an entire pictorial composition, and the description of each "component" or motif
                within a composition.  For example, the general description would note all the 
                human figures (whether identifiable by name or not) in a composition.  This is 
                followed by the description of each human figure as a separate "component."
                The component descriptions usually repeat the contents of the general description
                for that component, but the component descriptions can be (and often are) more
                detailed.  In many cases, the composition described is constituted by interlinear
                motifs, scattered throughout the text area in one of Blake's illuminated books,
                rather than a single composition as traditionally defined by art historians.

                The listing of individual "characteristics" for each component of each pictorial composition.  These characteristic lists permit the "image search" feature of the Archive.  Each component must have at least one characteristic to make it searchable.  The characteristics are limited to a set menu, arranged alphabetically on the image search page of the Archive under general categories (e.g., figure, animal, vegetation, etc.).  Any one component/motif may have a long list of characteristics; this is particularly true of human figures since these are intensively described in the Archive.  The component descriptions (see #3, above) often make use of the same vocabulary as the characteristics, but need not be identical in wording. Only the list of characteristics is searched.
                <p>
                  It is true that the image-search system operates as a verbal filter that
                  converts a pictorial image into a word or sequence of words.  Image searching is in fact a form of text searching, the "text" being the list of characteristics for each component.  This does not, however, constitute a criticism of the Archive, nor is it unique to computer search systems for pictures.  A motif (or what we call a "component") is a verbal entity as much as a visual representation.  The iconographic/symbolic interpretation of images depends upon the conversion of pictures into words.  That is, a particular visual shape must first be recognized as a "sheep" before the iconographic/symbolic meanings of sheep can be explored.  The conversion of picture into word has a long history in art criticism, a history pre-dating the Blake Archive by centuries.  Although shape recognition is necessary for the human eye and brain to recognize a particular shape as an identifiable motif, the Archive search feature does not itself deploy shape recognition.
