      <!--<h2 class="title">William Blake Archive Update</h2>-->
      <p>17 April 2000</p>
      
      
      <p>The William Blake Archive www.blakearchive.org is pleased to announce that
        it has received a two-year Preservation and Access Grant from the National
        Endowment for the Humanities. The editors and staff are most grateful for the
        support it provides as we begin to expand the Archive over the next few years
        to include Blake's drawings, paintings, and engravings.</p>
      
      
      <p>We are also very pleased to announce the publication of new electronic
        editions of <cite>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</cite> copies H and I, both
        in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, England. Printed in 1790 and 1827
        respectively, they join copies of <cite>Marriage</cite> in the Archive from
        other printings: copies C (1790), D (1795), and F (c. 1794). Copy G, from a
        c. 1818 printing, and copy K (plates 21-24) and copies L and M (separate
        printings of "A Song of Liberty") from a 1790 printing are forthcoming.</p>
      
      
      <p>The electronic editions have newly edited SGML-encoded texts and new
        images scanned and color-corrected from first-generation 4 x 5 inch
        transparencies; texts and images are fully searchable and supported by the
        Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates.</p>
      
      
      <p>With the publication of these two titles, the Archive now contains fully
        searchable and scalable electronic editions of 41 copies of 18 of Blake's 19
        illuminated books in the context of full bibliographic information about each
        work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions
        of all images, and extensive bibliographies. They also join our searchable
        SGML-encoded electronic edition of David V. Erdman's <cite>Complete Poetry
          and Prose of William Blake</cite>. With the forthcoming publication of
        <cite>Jerusalem</cite> copy E, the Archive will contain at least one copy of
        each of Blake's works in illuminated printing and multiple copies of
        most.</p>
      
      
      <p><cite>Marriage</cite> copy H, perhaps the most illuminated of Blake's
        illuminated books, appears initially to have relied on colored inks rather
        than watercolor washes for its coloring. It was produced with copy B in 1790,
        with plates printed in various shades of red, olive, and green inks on both
        sides of the leaves. The impressions forming copy B (Bodleian Library, Oxford
        University) are uncolored, and those forming copy H may also have been left
        in this state originally. But copy H was sold to the painter John Linnell,
        Blake's young patron, in 1821 for two pounds and two shillings (less than
        half of what he was asking for books of similar size and number of pages),
        and apparently at that time Blake extensively reworked the pages by coloring
        the illustrations, adding gold leaf (e.g., title page), streaking the
        background of the texts in yellows and blues, and, what is most unusual,
        going over the texts in various colored inks, letter by letter, line by line.
        The results are pages among the most colorful that Blake ever produced and
        texts among the most challenging editorially, with many key words and phrases
        visually highlighted (e.g., "Contraries" and "Human existence" of plate 3 set
        off by dark ink in lines rewritten in red ink). Such detailed refinishing
        also resulted in a book with stylistic features characteristic of productions
        both early (facing pages and plates printed without borders) and late
        (elaborate coloring and page numbers).</p>
      
      
      <p>One stylistic element characteristic of illuminated books produced c. 1818
        and later is the frameline, usually one thin line in red or black ink drawn a
        few centimeters around the image. Copy H has no framelines, probably because
        they would prove visually jarring for pages that face one another. But they
        are used to superb effect in <cite>Marriage</cite> copy I, where they set off
        each page as a miniature painting. Copy I, printed and colored in 1827 for
        Thomas Wainewright, was one of the last illuminated books produced by Blake.
        It was printed in orangish-red ink on one side of J. Whatman paper dated
        1825, numbered 1-27, and finished in gold, watercolors, and pen and ink to
        match Wainewright's copy of <cite>Songs</cite> (copy X). It was produced in
        the same style Blake used in c. 1818, 1821-22, and 1825-26. Works from these
        sessions include <cite>The Book of Thel</cite> copy O and <cite>Songs of
          Innocence and of Experience</cite> copies Z and AA, which are in the Archive,
        and <cite>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</cite> copy G,
        <cite>Jerusalem</cite> copy E, <cite>America, a Prophecy</cite> copy O,
        <cite>Europe, a Prophecy</cite> copy K, and <cite>Visions of the Daughters of
          Albion</cite> copy P, all of which will enter the Archive within the year.
        Printing plates in full (i.e., with their plate borders), a feature of this
        late production style, can make pages appear slightly larger and introduce
        compositional elements missing in copies printed earlier. For
        <cite>Marriage</cite> copy I, as well as copy G, the inclusion of the plate
        borders introduced the outer lines forming rocks and cavern shapes on plates
        10, 11, 15, and 20, images named in the text but pictured only in these last
        two copies.</p>
