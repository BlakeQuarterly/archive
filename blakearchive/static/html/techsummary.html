      <h3 class="c3">Imaging</h3>

<p><b>Scanning:</b> Since 2007, the Archive has stopped scanning transparencies and instead acquires images of Blake’s original works that are born digital. They are usually photographed according to our protocols outlined above (300 dpi TIFFs scaled 1:1 to the original image) and are more accurate, particularly with paper tone and texture, than transparencies. Occasionally these digital images come in at higher resolutions and 48-bit color instead of 24-bit color. We adjust these larger files/images in Adobe Photoshop to fit our imaging protocols. The born digital images come with grey scales and color bars to assist our color correcting them and are given Generic RBG Profile.</p>

<p>Before June 2012 most images were scaled 1:1 against the source dimensions of the original artifact but images larger than 40 x 30 cm were scaled 1:2/3 to reduce the file sizes of image enlargements. As of June 2012 all images are scaled 1:1 (to reflect increased digital storage capacity, higher bandwidth availability, and faster download speeds).</p>

<p>Raw TIFF images are now backed up to a dedicated server provided and maintained by the Archive instead of to DVDs or the Carolina Digital Library and Archive.</p>

<p><b>Color Correcting:</b> Since 2007, we continue to use the most current version of Adobe Photoshop with Apple 23” and 30" Cinema HD Displays connected to a MacPro and a 27 inch iMac. All displays have been calibrated with a GretagMacbeth Eye-One calibrator.</p>

<p><b>System Architecture:</b> We encode our data in XML documents we call Blake Archive Documents (BADs). We import the BADs into a PostgreSQL database and index them in Solr. The site itself is written in AngularJS, the JavaScript-based front-end framework, on top of Bootstrap for responsive design.</p>






      <h2 class="c2"><a id="1995">Technical Summary for 1995 - 2016</a></h2>  
      <p>The electronic files containing the texts, images, and supporting
apparatus for the William Blake Archive are distributed across three 
separate servers: the public site server (www.blakearchive.org), an internal testing site server, and
the file server containing our archives, records, and work in progress. 
All three servers run versions of the Linux operating system.  They are hosted
and maintained by the Library Systems department at the University of North Carolina.   


<!--Since December 2001, the public Archive has been mirrored on a Sun server located at Oxford University and maintained by Oxford University Computing Services (OUCS).--></p>




        
      
      <h3 class="c3">Imaging</h3>




        
      
      <p><b>Scanning:</b> We scan digital images from three types of source media: 4" x 5"
transparencies, 8" x 10" transparencies, and 35mm slides. The
transparencies, which include color bars and gray scales to ensure color
fidelity, are verified for color accuracy against the original artifact
by the photographer and often by an editor as well.</p>



        
      
      <p>In the past, we scanned transparencies on a Microtek Scanmaker III with a
transparent media adapter. We upgraded to a Microtek Scanmaker V in May
1998. This model offered two advances: a separate drawer to hold 4" x 5"
film inside the body of the scanner and Microtek's EDIT (Emulsion Direct
Imaging Technology) system. From 2002 until early 2005, we scanned
transparencies on a Microtek ArtixScan 1100, an advanced version of the
Scanmaker V. In 2005, we replaced the ArtixScan 1100 with a Microtek
Scanmaker i900.</p>



        
      
      <p>Slides are used only occasionally in the Archive; we scan them using the
35mm slide tray of the Scanmaker i900; in the past we used a Nikon
LS-3510AF Slide Scanner and a Microtek 35t Plus Scanner.</p>



        
      
      <p>We use the most recent version of Microtek's ScanWizard software (as of
this writing, 7.6). The i900 is attached to a dual 2GHz Power Macintosh
G5 running Mac OS X.</p>



        
      
            <p>We began with a baseline standard of 24-bit color and 300 dpi (dots per inch) resolution for all scanned images. Due to hardware improvements&#8212;more internal storage, more RAM, writeable CDs and DVDs, and better scanners&#8212;we are now scanning at 600 dpi. The 600 dpi "raw scans" are stored on DVD as LZW-compressed TIFFs, from which we derive 300 dpi TIFF images for color correction. Before June 2012 most images were scaled 1:1 against the source dimensions of the original artifact but images larger than 40 x 30 cm were scaled 1:2/3 to reduce the file sizes of image enlargements. As of June 2012 all images are scaled 1:1 (to reflect increased digital storage capacity, higher bandwidth availability, and faster download speeds).
            </p>
            <p>On a monitor with 100 dpi screen resolution most images display in the Object View Page at true size and their enlargements display at three times the size of the original. There are a few exceptions. Objects larger than 40 x 30 cm are displayed smaller than true size on Object View Pages to make them viewable in their entirety without the need for scrolling. These objects can be viewed at true size using the ImageSizer applet (see below). Very large images scanned before June 2012 have image enlargements that are two times larger than true size (rather than three times larger). Since images scanned at 1:2/3 cannot be retroactively enlarged without losing image quality, there is some scaling inconsistency between the enlargements available in the Archive. Each object view page lists the size of the physical object at the lower right-hand corner of the ImageSizer window. Users are advised to consult these measurements when in doubt about the true size of an object.</p>



        
      
      <p>As part of the scanning process for each image, a project assistant
completes a form known as an Image Production (IP) record. The IP records
contain detailed technical data about the creation of the digital file
for each image. These records are retained in hard copy at the project
office, and they become part of the Image Information record that is
inserted into each image as metadata (see below).</p>



        
      
      <p>To ensure color consistency, we calibrate our scanners and computer
monitors on a regular basis; to ensure image clarity, we use compressed
air to blow dust, lint, and hair from the scanner bed and the
transparency before each scan.</p>




        
      
      <p><b>Color Correction:</b> Using Adobe Photoshop, an editor
color-corrects the
"raw" scanned images against the original transparency or slide, which
has itself been color-corrected against the original artifact. Between
1996 and 2001, we used Adobe Photoshop 4.0 and 5.0 in conjunction with
hooded Radius PressView 17SR and 21SR monitors, calibrated using
ProSense
1.8 software. Between 2002 and 2004, we used LaCie Electron 19 Blue and
Electron 22 Blue monitors calibrated with the LaCie Blue Eye Sensor and
software. Between 2004 and 2007, we used Adobe Photoshop CS with Apple
20" Cinema and 23" Cinema HD Displays. As of this writing, we use
Adobe Photoshop CS3 and Apple 30" Cinema HD Displays. Since 2004, all
displays have been calibrated with a GretagMacbeth Eye-One calibrator. </p>


        
      
      <p>The color correction process is necessary in order to bring the color
channels of the digital image into alignment with the hues and color
tones of the original (see <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/public/about/tour/index.html">A Tour of the William Blake Archive</a>).
The
process can take up to several hours per image, though it ordinarily
takes around thirty minutes. This step is key in establishing the
scholarly integrity of the Archive, for it ensures that each image will
match the original artifact when displayed under optimal conditions.
Although we cannot control the color settings of an individual user's
monitor, we specify these optimal viewing conditions, allowing users to
adjust their monitor settings appropriately.</p>



        
      
      <p><b>File Formats and Archival Storage:</b> All scanned images are saved using the
Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) and archived as such on removable storage
media. The Archive began on 8mm magnetic Exabyte tape and is now
maintained on CD-ROM (in ISO 9660 hybrid format) and DVD.  In addition,
TIFF images are backed up to networked "dark archive" storage 
provided by Carolina Digital Library and Archives.  These archived
raw images would provide the source for newly color-corrected images if
necessary.</p>



      
      <p>The color-corrected images displayed to users in the online Archive are
presented in the JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group, ISO/IEC 10918)
format. Users are presented with an inline image in the Object View Page
at 100 dpi and have the option to view an enlargement at 300 dpi for the
study of details (see <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/public/about/tour/index.html">A Tour of the William Blake Archive</a>). The 100 dpi
JPEG is derived from the color-corrected 300 dpi JPEG using ImageMagick,
a UNIX software package that enables the batch processing of image files
from the command line.</p>




        
      
      <p><b>Metadata:</b> Each and every image in the Archive also contains textual
metadata comprising its Image Information record. The Image Information
record combines the technical data recorded in the Image Production
record (see above) with additional bibliographic documentation of the
image, as well as information pertaining to provenance, present location,
and the owning institution.</p>



      
      <p>These textual records are, at the most literal level, a part of the
Archive's image files. Image files are typically considered to be nothing
but information about the images themselves, but in practice, an image
file can be the container for several different kinds of information. The
William Blake Archive takes advantage of this capability by inserting its
Image Information records into the portion of the image file reserved for
textual metadata. This integration allows the record to travel with the
image, even if the image is downloaded and detached from the Archive.</p>



      
      <p>The Image Information record may be viewed using the "Info" button
located on the control panel of the Archive's ImageSizer applet (see
below) or with the Text Display feature of standard software such as
Adobe Photoshop or X-View.</p>



        
      
      <h3 class="c3">eXtensible Markup Language (XML)</h3>




        
      
      <p>All significant textual data in the Archive&mdash;Blake's actual poetry
and prose, as well as the editors' bibliographic commentary and
illustration descriptions&mdash;is encoded using <b>eXtensible Markup
Language</b> (XML). XML is not a programming language; it is a descriptive
meta-language used to encode (or "tag") textual data in such a way that
it will remain usable even as platforms and file formats change over
time. To take a very simple example, whereas the word processor used to
write this document would represent <i>italics</i> by means of a proprietary
binary code, XML would indicate italics with a plain ASCII tag such as:
&lt;hi rend="italic"&gt;this&lt;hi&gt;. But XML does not have to be merely
descriptive; unlike HTML, XML allows us to identify and encode the
      <i>structure</i> of documents. A title or heading (to once again take a very
simple example) can be tagged and described as such rather than being
simply rendered in a large font or in boldface, etc., as HTML would
encourage. By explicitly describing textual data according to a
recognized W3C standard, XML frees the Archive from reliance on the
vicissitudes of proprietary software packages.</p>



      
      <p>A set of XML tags designed for a specific purpose is known as a <b>Document
Type Definition</b> (DTD). A DTD provides a hierarchical system of contexts
and constraints which enables its tags to be used to create consistent
document structures. The Blake Archive makes use of several DTDs
developed specifically for the project when it was hosted at IATH. The primary and most
expansive of these is known as the <b>Blake Archive Description</b> (BAD). The
BAD DTD is used to encode all works at both the object and the
collection level; its emphasis is on the description of Blake's works as
physical artifacts. The BAD provides the basic document structure used to
deliver the Archive's content to users and also serves as the
information-base consulted by the Archive's search engines (see below).
The Archive's second DTD, the <b>Blake Object Description</b> (BOD) is used to
encode the textual metadata that constitutes the Image Information
record.</p>



      
      <p>The <b>Text Encoding Initiative</b> (TEI) DTD is used for other materials in the
archive, such as its bibliographies, collection lists and Erdman's
      <i>Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake</i>, where description of the
physical artifact is not the DTD's central purpose.</p>



      
      <p><b>The Archive on the Web</b>: Delivery of the William Blake Archive on the Web
is supported by three key components. All technologies are open source
and standards based. First, the XML-encoded documents are stored in and
indexed as an eXist database. Second, an assortment of custom XSL
transforms produce HTML from our XML. Third, Apache Cocoon plays traffic
cop, receiving and dispatching requests between users and applications.
Each of these technologies is described at greater length below.
      </p>

      
      <ul>


 <li><b>Apache Cocoon</b> is a Web development framework that facilitates
    communication between and coordinates responses among the independent
    components that provide the various functions offered by the Archive.
    It might be understood as the "glue" that binds the Apache server
    software, the eXist database of XML documents, and the XSL
    transforms. More information about Apache Cocoon is available <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org">here</a>.
 </li>

        <li><b>eXist</b> is an open source native XML database used by the Archive to
store, index, and search our XML-encoded documents. eXist utilizes
    xQuery for searching and offers both index-based and full-text
    searching. More information about eXist is available <a href="//exist.sourceforge.net/index.html">here</a>.
 </li>

        <li><b>eXtensible Stylesheet Language</b> (XSL) facilitates the transformation
    of our XML documents into HTML for display on the Web. Since XML
    describes the structure and semantics of a document rather than
    specifying preferences for its display, an XSL transform must be
    written to translate the XML into HTML. Also called stylesheets, XSL
    transforms can turn XML into many data formats, including ASCII text,
    HTML, and PDF. The William Blake Archive relies on a variety of XSL
    stylesheets to transform our XML-encoded documents into the HTML web
    pages accessed by our users. This translation happens "on the fly,"
    meaning that there is no need for us to create and maintain separate
    HTML files to mirror the Archive's XML-encoded materials. Rather, our
    XML is rendered as HTML by the XSL stylesheets whenever it is
    accessed by a user with a Web browser.
        </li>

      
      </ul>


      
      <p></p>



        
      
      <h3 class="c3">Java</h3>




        
      
      <p><a href="http://www.javasoft.com">Java</a> is a platform-independent programming language developed by Sun
Microsystems in order to facilitate object-oriented programming in
conjunction with the HTTP layer of the World Wide Web. 
Software written in Java can be "run" (activated) directly from ordinary
Web pages, without requiring users to have pre-installed any of the
software's files on their own personal machine and without regard for the
type of computer or operating system used to access the Web page 
from which the Java software is invoked. The Blake Archive uses two separate Java applets (or
applications).  Both were developed at IATH, and continue to be maintained at CDLA, in order to support the image-based
editing that is fundamental to the project. Both of these applets, Inote
and the ImageSizer, should be understood as computational implementations
of the editorial practices governing the design of the Archive and its
scholarly objectives. Both applets are based on version 1.3 of the Java
Development Kit (JDK).</p>




        
      
      <p><b>Inote:</b> Inote is an image-annotation tool. It permits us to append textual
notes ("annotations") to selected regions (or "details") of a particular
image; these annotations are generated directly from the XML-encoded
illustration descriptions prepared by the editors. Inote functions most
powerfully when used in conjunction with the Archive's image searching
capabilities, where it can open an image found by the search engine,
zoomed to the quadrant of the image containing the object(s) of the
search query, with the relevant textual annotation displayed in a
separate window (see <a href="../tour/index.html">A
        Tour of the William Blake Archive</a>). From there,
Inote allows the user to enlarge the image for further study and/or to
access additional annotations located in other regions of the image.
Inote may also be invoked directly from any of the Archive's Object View
Pages, allowing users to "browse" the annotations created for a given
image (see <a href="../tour/index.html">A Tour of the William Blake
        Archive</a>).</p>



      
      <p>In addition, users can download and install their own executable copies
of Inote on their personal computers (using a version of the software
programmed in the Java Runtime Environment); upon doing so, they may
attach annotations of their own making to locally saved copies of an
image, for use in either teaching or research. The most recent release of
Inote is version 6.0.</p>




        
      
      <p><b>ImageSizer:</b> The ImageSizer is a sophisticated image
        manipulation tool (see <a href="../tour/index.html">A Tour of the William Blake Archive</a>). Its principal function for the
Archive is to allow users to view Blake's work on their computer screens
at its actual physical dimensions. Users may invoke the ImageSizer's
calibration applet to set a "cookie" informing the ImageSizer of their
own unique screen-resolution. Based on this data (recorded in the
cookie), all subsequently viewed images will be resized on the fly so as
to appear at their true size on the user's screen. If a user returns to
the Archive at some later date from the same machine, the data stored by
the cookie will remain intact, and there will be no need to recalibrate.
Users may also set the ImageSizer's calibration applet to deliver images
sized at consistent proportions other than true size, for example, at
twice normal size (for the study of details). In addition, the ImageSizer
allows users to enlarge or reduce the image within its on-screen display
area, and to view the textual metadata comprising the Image Information
record embedded in each digital image file (see above).</p>




        
      
      <h3 class="c3">Other</h3>




        
      
      <p><b>Work in Progress Site:</b> The Archive maintains a password-protected Work in
Progress (WIP) site for the exclusive use of the editors and the project
staff. The WIP site provides gateways to private testing ports on our
servers, which allow us to proof works in the Archive's online
environment without their being publicly accessible to users before
they've reached their finished state. The WIP site also houses a variety
of "tracking sheets," enabling the editors and project staff to
accurately monitor the different stages of preparation for the many
hundreds of text and image files in the Archive, as well as a Reference
area for other materials (such as an "X-Files" of unsolved problems,
agendas for project meetings, copies of grant and development materials,
a complete archive of postings from the blake-proj list, etc.&mdash;see
below).</p>




        
      
      <p><b>E-mail:</b>  The Blake Archive currently operates three electronic mailing
lists. The oldest of these, an internal communications list known as
"blake-proj," has existed since the project's inception and serves as the
focal point for discussions among the editors, the project staff, and the
technical staff at CDLA. All traffic on blake-proj is archived
and available to the project editors and staff. A second internal list,
"blake-board," was created in fall of 1998 to facilitate communication
between the editors and the Archive's <a href="../../../board.html">Advisory Board</a>. Finally, a public
list, also created in 1998 and known as "blake-update," is used for
distribution of periodic updates and announcements to our users. Any
visitor to the Archive may subscribe to blake-update <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/public/subscribe.html">via a form on our
front-end Web pages</a>. All lists are maintained by the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill using the <a href="http://www.lyris.com/software/listmanager/">Lyris Listmanager</a> software.</p>




        
      
      <p><b>Access Tracking:</b> Access to the Archive's servers is tracked 
by the Apache Web server.  The log files provide daily records 
that allow us to observe the frequency with which texts
and images are requested by users, as well as the type of browser and
platform being used to access the Archive, the IP address of the users,
and their domain name (allowing us to compare, say, access from
educational sites with access from commercial sites).</p>




        
      
      <p><b>Backup and Record Keeping</b>: All of the Archive's data is safeguarded via
daily, incremental backups.  Weekly backups are stored off-site.  In the event of a catastrophic disk failure
or a server break-in, the Archive's data could be quickly restored from
the backup system.</p>



      
      <p>The Archive's project office retains hard copies of all Image Production
records, as well as ledgers tracking electronic file transfers,
consignment of TIFF images to CD-ROM, and shipping of transparencies and
slides.</p>
