      <P>
        The William Blake Archive is pleased to announce 
        the publication of electronic editions of 
        the Linnell set of Blake's water color illustrations to The Book of Job and
        the sketchbook containing Blake's reduced drawings preparatory for the Job engravings.  
        The sketchbook is reproduced complete and in color for the first time.  
        These two important sets of 
        Job illustrations join the Butts set of water colors and the engravings, both previously 
        published in the Archive.  Thus, the Archive now includes all four series of Job 
        illustrations.  The engravings are fully searchable.
        The Linnell set of water colors and the sketchbook are presented in our Preview mode,
        one that provides all the features of the Archive 
        except Image Search and Inote (our image annotation program).

          Blake's pictorial engagements with The Book of Job extended over many decades.  
          His first efforts were a small group of wash drawings of the mid-1780s showing Job in 
          his misery with his wife and three friends.  Another version of this subject appears among 
          the emblem series that Blake sketched in his Notebook, but the composition appearing in the 
          wash drawings culminated in the large intaglio etching/engraving, "Job," which Blake listed in 
          his advertisement <i>To the Public</i> of 10 October 1793.  This print may have stimulated 
          Blake's chief patron, Thomas Butts, to commission a tempera painting, <i>Job and His Daughters</i>, 
          c. 1799-1800 and, about six years later, a series of nineteen water colors illustrating the 
          story of Job (the so-called "Butts set").  In 1821, Blake and his new patron John Linnell 
          borrowed the water colors from Butts.  Linnell traced the series and Blake colored 
          them (the so-called "Linnell set").  Blake also added two more compositions to this 
          later group and added versions of these same compositions to the earlier group, so that 
          both sets now have twenty-one designs.  The Linnell set led directly to his commission for the 
          engravings.  These began as a series of reduced sketches executed in 1823; the engravings 
          themselves, with a title page added, were not finished and published until 1826.

            As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and 
            charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible through the continuing support of the 
            Library of Congress, the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the 
            University of Virginia, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and by the 
            cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously 
            given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.
