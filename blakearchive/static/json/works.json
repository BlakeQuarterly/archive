Cromek planned to select twenty of these designs for a de luxe edition of the poem. In Cromek's first prospectus of November 1805, Blake is named as both the designer and engraver of fifteen designs. The prospectus further states that \"the original Drawings, and a Specimen of the Stile of Engraving, may be seen at the Proprietor's, Mr. Cromek.\" The \"Specimen\" is probably this white-line etching of Deaths Door. Its rugged and primitive boldness, coupled with public reaction to such a \"Style of Engraving,\" apparently convinced Cromek to find another craftsman to engrave Blake's designs. In a second prospectus, also of November 1805, Cromek announced that Luigi (or Louis) Schiavonetti would engrave twelve designs for the new edition. Blake had lost both the chance to introduce one of his highly individual graphic techniques into a commercial project and the potentially lucrative commission to engrave his own designs. His relationship with Cromek soon descended into anger and argument.

Cromek promoted the book  aggressively and the illustrations to The Grave became Blake's best known work through much of the  nineteenth century. We present here the twenty water-color illustrations originally selected by Cromek for  publication.  These were sold at an auction in Edinburgh in 1836, but were unknown until the  dramatic rediscovery of nineteen of the water colors in 2001.  These were sold individually  at auction in May 2006 and are now widely dispersed; most are now in private collections.   For details about provenance and current ownership, see the Work Information page. One design originally part of the group, as indicated by the size and style of its backing  mat, became detached from its companions, probably in the mid-nineteenth century.  This work,  The Widow Embracing her Husband's Grave (Yale Center for British Art, Butlin 633), has been  included here.  The designs are arranged according to the sequence of passages illustrated,  with those designs not based on any specific passage in Blair's poem grouped at the end. Schiavonetti's engravings published in Cromek's 1808 edition of The Grave and the white-line etching of \"Deaths Door\" are also available in the Archive (see Commercial Book Illustrations,  and Separate Prints and Prints in Series, in the main table of \"Works in the  William Blake Archive\").

        "info": "Although there are no extant documentary records of the contract, it was probably in late 1794 or early  1795 that the publisher Richard Edwards commissioned Blake to illustrate a new, deluxe edition of  Edward Young's long meditative poem, The Complaint, and the Consolation; or, Night Thoughts, first  published in 1742-45 and generally known by the short title of Night Thoughts.  This was the largest  commercial project for which Blake was ever employed.  With what must have been enormous energy, he  executed 537 water colors (Butlin 330.1-537) illustrating the poem's nine sections, which Young called  \"Nights.\"  Edwards began the project by having the pages from the first and second editions of the poem glued into windows cut into large leaves of Whatman wove paper. These text pages were positioned slightly off-center so as to create a lower margin greater  than the upper and an outer margin greater than the inner, as in most letterpress books.  Blake filled  these large marginal spaces with his designs\u00ef\u00be\u008a\u00ef\u00be\u0097\u00ef\u00be\u0094a format retained in the published engravings with the  letterpress text of the poem printed in a central framed panel.  Blake was paid the paltry sum of twenty  guineas for his water colors, presumably because he expected to receive a great deal more for the engravings.   Although all the water colors may not have been completed by the spring of 1796, Blake began at that time to etch  and engrave a selection of forty-three designs illustrating the first four Nights.  These were published  in 1797 as the first of four intended large quarto volumes.  The registration of the plates to the sheets of  paper, which were barely large enough to accommodate the engravings, was frequently poor, with the  result that even untrimmed copies of the book are missing small marginal areas of some of the designs  and/or the imprints and Blake's monogram signatures in the lower margins.  Before any further volumes  could be produced, Edwards closed his publishing business.  Blake's disappointment must have been  profound.  The failure of the Night Thoughts project may have been one of the reasons why Blake decided,  in 1800, to move from London to the village of Felpham on the Sussex coast and place himself under the  patronage of William Hayley.Most of the water colors bear a cross or star to the left of the line (or first line of the passage)  illustrated.  This procedure was continued, somewhat irregularly, through the use of asterisks in  the published volume.  In some cases, the line preceded by an asterisk in the engravings is not the  same as in the corresponding water colors.  Many copies of the 1797 volume contain a two-page \"Explanation  of the Engravings,\" possibly written by Blake's friend and fellow-artist Henry Fuseli.  The texts of these  commentaries are included in the Editors' Notes for each plate.While Blake based his designs closely on the text, many of the images are based on personifications or  metaphors in the poem.  This approach tends to literalize what is only a figure of speech in the text,  thereby confounding conventional distinctions between the literal and the metaphoric.  Further, Blake  drew heavily on his own repertory of motifs and postures when illustrating Young, and thus there are  many parallels between the Night Thoughts designs and the pictures in Blake's illuminated books.  The  influence of the Night Thoughts project on Blake's writings is most directly evinced by his division  of his long manuscript poem, Vala or The Four Zoas (Bentley 209), into nine Nights.  That manuscript  also contains forty-seven pre-publication proofs of the Night Thoughts engravings, with lines of The  Four Zoas written in the text panels.  A further group of twenty-four proofs is now in the Houghton  Library, Harvard University.Copy 1 presented here is uncolored; copy 2 is one of at least twenty-seven copies with contemporary  or near-contemporary hand coloring.  The colorist or colorists have never been convincingly identified.   The same palette appears to have been used for most copies, but the placement of the colors varies  somewhat among copies.  Such variation is not characteristic of the commercial hand coloring of the  late eighteenth century in which a model is followed very closely.  Some scholars have divided the  colored copies into two styles, one dated to c. 1797 and the other to c. 1805.  There are, however,  colors common to the palettes of these two styles.  Two copies (Yale Center for British Art and  Houghton Library, Harvard University) bear early inscriptions attributing their coloring to Blake;  a copy in the Library of Congress has a pencil inscription attributing its coloring to Blake's wife  Catherine.  Five copies bear J C (or possibly H) monograms that would seem to relate to their coloring. ",

The last presents an alternative arrangement of the plates independent of the textual sequence of lines illustrated. A second edition was published by Rudolph Ackermann in 1813; he also reprinted the plates, with inscribed titles in Spanish, in Jose Joaquin de Mora's Meditaciones Poeticas (1826), a series of poems written in response to Blake's designs. Nineteen of the finished water-color preliminary drawings for The Grave were rediscovered in 2001, as noted for each in the list of \"Related Works,\" below. For this group, see  \"Illustrations to Robert Blair's The Grave\" under Water Color  Drawings in the main table of \"Works in the William Blake Archive.\"Blake's designs illustrate both major incidences in the poem and brief passages. His selection of subjects and themes emphasizes immortality more than the death, the latter often presented as a passage to the former.

        "info": "Blake's final and longest epic in illuminated printing constitutes a recapitulation and summation of his multiple interests, ranging from his own mythology to biblical history, from sexuality to epistemology, and from the Druids to Newton. The cast of characters is vast, but Los (the artist's imagination at work in the material world), Jerusalem and Albion (the female and male portions of divided humanity who must be reunited), the nature goddess Vala, and Jesus play major roles. The poem is divided into four chapters, each addressed to a different audience: the Public, the Jews, the Deists, and the Christians. Jerusalem concludes with a vision of human consciousness in a post-apocalyptic universe. Portions of The Four Zoas, Blake's long manuscript poem, are repeated (often with little revision) in Jerusalem.The one-hundred plates of Jerusalem were etched in relief, with many designs in white-line etching, between c. 1804 (the date on the title page) and 1820. Sixty plates may have been completed by 1807; a few examples were exhibited in 1812. The printing of 1820 produced copies A, C, and D. In the next year, Blake printed copies B (chapter 1 only, plates 1-25) and E. Copy F was printed, but left uncollated by Blake, in 1827. Copies H-J are posthumous. There are two arrangements of the plates in chapter 2, early (copies A and C) and late (copies D and E). Copy F was collated by John Linnell, using copy C as a model. Most lifetime copies have hand tinting in gray or black, but only copies B and E are colored.",

        "info": " The poetry of John Milton was important to Blake as both poet and artist from his earliest years. As he told John Flaxman in a letter of 12 September 1800, \"Milton lovd me in childhood & shewd me his face\" (Erdman page 707). Several early drawings, such as the Satan, Sin, and Death of c. 1780 (Butlin 101), were probably inspired by Milton. In 1790-92, Blake loosely sketched several illustrations to Paradise Lost in his Notebook (Butlin 201). He composed his first series of water colors illustrating one of Milton's poems in 1801 when the Rev. Joseph Thomas commissioned eight designs for Comus (Butlin 527).  Blake produced a set of twelve Paradise Lost designs in 1807 for the same patron (Butlin 529, sometimes called the \"small\" set).  In the next year, Blake executed another series of twelve Paradise Lost designs, with a larger format, for Thomas Butts (Butlin 536, sometimes called the \"large\" set). We know from John Linnell's journal that Blake \"began copies from his Drawings from Miltons P.L.\" on 9 May 1822 (Butlin page 388).  This is almost certainly a reference to the three water colors illustrating Paradise Lost presented here (Butlin 537).  They were probably commissioned by Linnell and remained in his family's possession until their dispersal at auction in 1918.  It may have been Blake's  intention to produce another set of twelve water colors, much as he had produced for Linnell a complete set of water colors illustrating the Book of Job in 1821, but only the three extant designs are known.  They are based on the fourth, eighth, and eleventh illustrations in the Butts series.  In comparison to these models, the Linnell water colors show an increased emphasis on dramatic lighting, particularly evident in the radiance surrounding Christ in \"Michael Foretells the Crucifixion\" (object 3). Blake's literary response to the life and works of John Milton finds its fullest expression in the illuminated book Milton a Poem.",

He composed his first series of water colors illustrating one of Milton's poems in 1801 when  the Rev. Joseph Thomas commissioned the eight designs for Comus (Butlin 527) presented here.  This commission  and its date are established by John Flaxman's comment in a postscript to Blake in a letter to William Hayley of 31  July 1801: \"The Revd. Joseph Thomas of Epsom desires you will at your leisure, make a few sketches of the same size  [as each other], which maybe any size you please from Milton's Comus for Five Guineas\" (Butlin volume 1, page 373).   Thomas later acquired (very probably on commission) a set of twelve water color illustrations to Paradise  Lost in 1807 (Butlin 529) and six water colors illustrating \"On the Morning of Christ's Nativity\" in 1809  (Butlin 538).  In about 1815, Blake produced another set of Comus designs for his patron Thomas Butts (Butlin  528).  This later group pictures the same eight subjects, but with many significant differences in motifs and in the  positions and portrayals of characters from the poem. Here, as usual in his work as an illustrator of other poets' works, Blake paid close attention to the text, but  this disciplined approach did not preclude his  own interpretations.  For example, Milton ends his  masque with joyous dance and song, but Blake ends his illustrations on a more serious note, as indicated by the  facial expressions of all six figures.  The selection of passages to illustrate in itself reveals Blake's emphasis  on unusual states of consciousness, including trances and visions. Blake's literary response to the life and works of John Milton finds its fullest expression in the illuminated book  Milton a Poem. ",

        "info": "Blake's twenty-two engraved Illustrations of the Book of Job are the culmination of his long pictorial engagement with that biblical subject. His first efforts were a small group of wash drawings of the mid-1780s showing Job in his misery with his wife and three friends (Butlin 162-64). Another version of this subject appears among Blake's emblem series he sketched in his Notebook (Butlin 201.20), but the composition appearing in the wash drawings became the basis for the large intaglio etching/engraving, \"Job\" (Essick V), which Blake listed in his advertisement To the Public of 10 October 1793. This print may have stimulated Blake's chief patron, Thomas Butts, to commission a tempera painting, Job and His Daughters (Butlin 394) c. 1799-1800 and, about six years later, a series of nineteen water colors illustrating the story of Job (Butlin 550, the so-called \"Butts Set\"). In 1821, Blake and his new patron John Linnell borrowed the water colors from Butts. Linnell traced the series and Blake colored them (Butlin 551, the so-called \"Linnell Set\"). Blake also added two more compositions to this later group and added versions of these same compositions to the earlier group, so that both sets now have twenty-one designs.The Linnell set led directly to his commissioning of the engravings, as set forth in a contract dated 25 March 1823. Blake first executed a series of twenty-one reduced pencil sketches of the central designs (Butlin 557). These he transferred to copperplates. Rather than using the customary \"mixed method\" of preliminary etching followed by engraving, Blake used pure line engraving in the Job plates. Perhaps one of his motivations was to evoke the art of the master engravers of the Renaissance whom Blake greatly admired, such as Albrecht D\u00ef\u00be\u0092_rer. The Job engravings are generally considered to be Blake's masterpiece as an intaglio printmaker.According to John Linnell, the border designs, unique to the engraved series, were a last-minute addition to the copperplates. Blake also added a title page, perhaps late in the production process. The title page is not numbered, but all the others are numbered, upper right in the copperplate, 1-21. The plate numbered \"1\" (object 3 here) was mistakenly dated 1828 in the imprint; all the others were dated 1825. Linnell's account books show that the engravings were not published until March 1826.Blake follows the general outline of the story of Job in the Bible, but also incorporates into his designs many motifs representing his personal interpretation. At the beginning, Job and his family attend only to the letter, rather than the spirit, of God's laws. Job thereby falls under a false conception of God and into the hands of Satan. Job's sufferings are recorded in the first half of the series, culminating in his horrific vision of a devil-god in the eleventh design. Job's spiritual education and material restoration are pictured in the second half of the series. In the penultimate design, Job tells his story to his daughters; the entire family is restored to life in the final design. Some critics and biographers have interpreted the Job series as personal statements about Blake's own tribulations and the spiritual peace he found late in life. However appealing this approach may be, it is made questionable by the early dating of the Butts series, the basis for all the later series.",

These began as a series of reduced sketches executed in 1823 (Butlin 557); the engravings themselves, with a title page added, were not finished and published until 1826.The Linnell set of twenty-one water colors is presented here.  Its joint production by Linnell and Blake and its dating are based on Linnell's journal, wherein he records that he \"Traced outlines from Mr Blakes Designs from Job [the Butts set] all day\" on 8 September 1821.  On 10 September, he again \"Traced outlines from Mr Blake's drawings of Job--all day,\" and \"Mr Blake finishing the outlines--all day.\"  See G. E. Bentley, Jr., Blake Records, 2nd ed. (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2004) 379.Blake follows the general outline of the story of Job in the Bible, but also incorporates into his designs many motifs representing his personal interpretation.  At the beginning, Job and his family attend only to the letter, rather than the spirit, of God's laws.  Job thereby falls under a false conception of God and into the hands of Satan.  Job's sufferings are recorded in the first half of the series, culminating in his horrific vision of a devil-god in the eleventh design.  Job's spiritual education and material restoration are pictured in the second half of the series.  In the penultimate design, Job tells his story to his daughters; the entire family is restored to life in the final design.  Some critics and biographers have interpreted the Job series as personal statements about Blake's own tribulations and the spiritual peace he found late in life.  However appealing this approach may be, it is made questionable by the earlier dating of the Butts series, the basis for all the later works.",

        "info": "Blake's pictorial engagements with The Book of Job extended over many decades. His first efforts were a small group of wash drawings of the mid-1780s showing Job in his misery with his wife and three friends (Butlin 162-164). Another version of this subject appears among Blake's emblem series he sketched in his Notebook (Butlin 201.20), but the composition appearing in the wash drawings culminated in the large intaglio etching/engraving, \"Job\" (Essick V) which Blake listed in his advertisement To the Public of 10 October 1793. This print may have stimulated Blake's chief patron, Thomas Butts, to commission a tempera painting, Job and His Daughters (Butlin 394) c. 1799-1800 and, about six years later, a series of nineteen water colors illustrating the story of Job (Butlin 550, the so-called \"Butts Set\"). In 1821, Blake and his new patron John Linnell borrowed the water colors from Butts. Linnell traced the series and Blake colored them (Butlin 551, the so-called \"Linnell Set\"). Blake also added two more compositions to this later group and added versions of these same compositions to the earlier group, so that both sets now have twenty-one designs. The Linnell set led directly to his commissioning engravings.

        "info": "The poetry of John Milton was important to Blake as both poet and artist from his earliest years. As he told John Flaxman in a letter of 12 September 1800, \"Milton lovd me in childhood & shewd me his face\" (Erdman page 707). Several early drawings, such as the Satan, Sin, and Death of c. 1780 (Butlin 101), were probably inspired by Milton. In 1790-92, Blake loosely sketched several illustrations to Paradise Lost in his Notebook (Butlin 201). He composed his first series of water colors illustrating one of Milton's poems in 1801 when the Rev. Joseph Thomas commissioned eight designs for Comus (Butlin 527). Thomas later acquired (very probably on commission) a set of twelve water color illustrations to Paradise Lost in 1807 (Butlin 529) and, in 1809, six water colors illustrating \"On the Morning of Christ's Nativity\" (Butlin 544). Between 1808 and 1815, Blake produced similar (but not in every respect identical) sets of the Paradise Lost and \"Nativity\" designs for Thomas Butts (Butlin 529, 542). Twelve illustrations to \"L'Allegro\" and \"Il Penseroso\" for Butts followed c. 1816-20. The twelve designs for Paradise Regained presented here are on the same paper, watermarked 1816, Blake used for the \"L'Allegro\" and \"Il Penseroso\" designs. Dated by Butlin to c. 1816-20, the Paradise Regained designs may have also been commissioned by Butts, but they were apparently either never delivered to him, or returned by him to Blake, since John Linnell's account books indicate that he purchased the designs directly from Blake in 1825. Thus it is possible that the Paradise Regained designs were produced at a later date, c. 1820-25, on commission for Linnell.The Paradise Regained designs exemplify Blake's mature style as a water colorist and his close attention to the text he is illustrating. Many of the designs significantly juxtapose the dignified symmetry and calm repose of Blake's portrayals of Christ with the anxious and twisting energies of Satan. Through the deployment of such postures and gestures, Blake dramatizes the poem's conflict between divine imagination and satanic materialism. This struggle offers a pictorial analogue to the contests between the Zoas and their Spectres or Selfhoods in Blake's epic poems.Blake's literary response to the life and works of John Milton finds its fullest expression in the illuminated book Milton a Poem.",

The choice of subjects, all from the \"Inferno,\" may have been recommended, or at least approved, by Linnell. There may have been plans to engrave more designs, but even these 7 plates were left incomplete at Blake's death in 1827. The copperplates became Linnell's possession, but it was not until 1838 that he had sets printed for sale.Like Blake's Job engravings, the Dante plates are pure line engravings without preliminary etching. Although it is difficult to determine Blake's stylistic intentions from unfinished plates, the Dante engravings suggest the influence of Renaissance Italian prints, including the dramatic \"broad manner\" work of Andrea Mantegna, the artist called \"the Dante of his profession\" by Blake's friend George Cumberland.

        "info": "Blake's 102 drawings illustrating Dante's Divine Comedy were commissioned by John Linnell, the chief patron of Blake's final years. Although Linnell did not begin to pay for the designs until December 1825, at the rate of about 1 pound a week, Blake probably began work on the drawings by the fall of 1824. They were left at Blake's death in 1827 in various stages of completion, ranging from pencil sketches to highly finished water colors. Most show an expressive freedom in the handling of color washes far greater than Blake's earlier water colors. In 1826, Blake began to engrave large plates based on 7 of the designs; these were also left incomplete at his death. The water colors remained in Linnell's collection and estate until their sale at auction in 1918. Through a scheme organized by the National Art-Collections Fund, they were dispersed among 7 participating institutions: the Ashmolean Museum, Birmingham Museums & Art Gallery, the British Museum, the Fogg Art Museum, the National Gallery of Victoria, the Royal Institution of Cornwall, and the Tate Collection.As we generally find with Blake's illustrations to the works of other writers, he has paid close attention to the details of Dante's poem. Yet, while faithful to the text, Blake also brings his own perspective to bear on some of Dante's central themes, including sin, guilt, punishment, revenge, and salvation. In several designs, Blake's pictorial imagery, particularly when associated with similar motifs in his illuminated books and their iconography, indicates a critical attitude towards Dante. This interpretation of the illustrations is buttressed by Blake's verbal criticisms of Dante found in his c. 1800 annotations to Henry Boyd's translation of The Inferno, his conversations with Henry Crabb Robinson in 1825, and his inscriptions on the rectos of a few of the Dante designs themselves. But harsh criticism coexists with many signs of intellectual sympathy in the illustrations.We have recorded in the Editors' Notes the inscriptions on the versos of the designs. None of these is attributable to Blake; some probably represent at least 2 attempts to organize the designs into their proper sequence. The arrangement of images given here accords with our understanding of the sequence of passages illustrated and varies at several junctures from Butlin's ordering.",

The design and its execution in copper were commissioned by his friend of many years, George Cumberland.  The card may have been originally intended as a calling card rather than a bookplate.  The early history of the plate is well documented.  Blake first refers to it in his letter to Cumberland of 12 April 1827: \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdThe Little Card I will do as soon as Possible but when you Consider that I have been reduced to a Skeleton from which I am slowly recovering you will I hope have Patience with me\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd (Erdman page 784).  Blake\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds fatal illness did indeed impede work on the engraving, left unfinished at his death on 12 August 1827.  Cumberland\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds son, George Jr., took delivery of the copperplate from Blake\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds wife Catherine on 17 January 1828 and paid her \u00ce\u00a33.3s. for it.  Shortly after receiving the plate, George Jr. wrote to his father that \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdM.rs Blake sends her Compts with many thanks[;] she tells me that the Card would have been more finished if WB had lived[,] that it was the last thing he attempted to engrav\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd (Bentley, Records, page 482). Cumberland had sent a copperplate of his calling card to Blake so that he could add a design to it.  This plate very probably already had Cumberland\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds name engraved on it by a writing engraver.  Even if Blake began with a new piece of copper, a writing engraver may have added the name.  Blake appears to have executed his design with the graver and drypoint needle without preliminary etching.  Most extant impressions are on paper rather than card, in either black or brown ink, and may have been printed after Cumberland\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds death in 1848.  There are no recorded impressions of the plate lacking Cumberland\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds name; the copperplate itself is untraced. Blake inscribed the plate, lower right, with his name and age, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdA \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 70.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd  He may have sensed that 1827 could well be the last year of his life, but took pride in being capable of pursuing his art and craft to the end.  Blake was in fact 69 when he died; perhaps he inscribed \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd70\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd on the Cumberland card in anticipation of working on it until he turned that age.  At least when considered in retrospect, this most unusual inscription contributes to the elegiac and prophetic iconography of the design. ",

        "info": "In the final months of his three-year sojourn in Felpham, Blake began working on two sketches based on a painting of a shipwreck and a self-portrait by the artist George Romney. These were prepared as preliminary drawings for engravings to illustrate Hayley\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds biography of Romney. In a letter to John Flaxman of 7 August 1803, Hayley reveals that Blake had \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdmade two excellent drawings of Romney,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd one of which was after an unfinished self-portrait of Romney in Hayley\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds possession, before stating that he intends for both drawings to be \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdengraved for a single quarto volume of [Romney\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds] Life\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd (Bentley, Records, page 157). In the same letter, Hayley reveals that after some haggling with Blake over fees, they had agreed on a price of 40 guineas for a portrait engraving of Romney\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds self-portrait.  Shortly after he returned to London, Blake wrote to Hayley on 7 October 1803, stating \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI lose no moment to complete Romney to satisfaction\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd (Erdman page 736). Over the next few weeks Blake made significant progress on the plate, informing Hayley on 26 October, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI go on finishing Romney with spirit\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd (Erdman page 738). In a letter to Hayley of 13 December, Blake implies that the plate was sufficiently finished for proofs to be taken: \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdMr Romney[s] Portrait goes on with spirit. I do not send a proof because I cannot get one the Printers [being] <having been this afternoon> unable or unwilling & my Press not yet being put up\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd (Erdman page 739). By the beginning of May 1804, Blake had either assembled his own press or convinced the copperplate printer to pull a proof impression, which Blake showed to one of Romney\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds oldest friends, Adam Walker (Blake\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds letter to Hayley, 4 May 1804, Erdman page 748). On 22 June Blake offered Hayley another update, citing his former partner, James Parker, to emphasize the plate\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds quality: \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdHead of Romney is in very great forwardness.

On 16 July 1804 Blake finally sent Hayley a proof, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdstill [in] an unfinishd state\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd (Erdman page 753).Blake continued to work on the portrait engraving during the second half of 1804. In his letter of 7 August, Blake describes working on \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdRomneys Head\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd with \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdSpirit & neatness.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd In a letter to Hayley of 28 September, Blake promises a second proof of the engraving: \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdYou shall soon see a Proof of Him in a very advancd state.

On 23 October Blake claims that he will soon send proofs of \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthe Head of R\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and repeats this claim in his letter of 4 December (Erdman pages 756-57). Blake finally sent Hayley the second proof on 18 December and ten days later sent Hayley a letter commenting that \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI am very far from shewing the Portrait of Romney as a finishd Proof. be assured that with our Good Flaxmans good help & with your remarks on it in addition I hope to make it a Supernaculum\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd (Erdman pages 758-60). In a postscript, Blake reiterates his claim that the portrait engraving required more work: \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI made a very high finishd Drawing <of Romney> as a Companion to my <drawings of the> head of Cowper (you remember) with which Flaxman is very much satisfied & says that when my Print is like that I need wish it no better, & I am determind to make it so at least\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd (Erdman page 760). Despite these assurances, Hayley did not include the engraving in his biography of Romney, not published until 1809. Only Blake\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds engraving of the shipwreck design appears in the book.Blake\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds sketch for the Romney portrait engraving was auctioned at Sotheby\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds on 29 April 1862, lot 178, but has not been recorded since that sale.

Divided into sections entitled \"Africa\" and \"Asia,\" The Song of Los is the last of Blake's \"Continental Prophecies\" (see also America [1793] and Europe [1794]). Blake abandons direct references to contemporary events to pursue the junctures among biblical narrative, the origins of law and religion, and his own developing mythology. Adam, Noah, Socrates, Brama, Los, Urizen and many others represent both historical periods and states of consciousness. The loose narrative structure reaches towards a vision of universal history ending with apocalyptic resurrection.Plates 1, 2, 5, and 8 (the frontispiece, title page, and two full-page designs) are color-printed drawings, executed and printed in the planographic manner of\u00ef\u00be\u008a\u00ef\u00be\u0097\u00ef\u00be\u0094and probably concurrent with\u00ef\u00be\u008a\u00ef\u00be\u0097\u00ef\u00be\u0094most of the twelve Large Color Printed Drawings of 1795, also in the Archive.

        "info": "The thirty-seven plates of John Flaxman's illustrations to The Works Days and Theogony of Hesiod are one of Blake's major endeavors as a commercial etcher/engraver of designs by other artists.  Flaxman began to sketch designs based on Hesiod's poems in the early 1790s, but it was not until February 1816 that he entered into a contract with the publisher Longman & Co. to \"furnish a series of Drawings to illustrate Hesiod\" (Bentley page 556).  Blake had already been commissioned to execute the plates, almost certainly on the recommendation of Flaxman, a friend of many years.  Inscriptions on a set of pre-publication proofs in the Bodleian Library indicate that Blake submitted impressions to Longman between November 1814 and October 1816; the project was completed by January 1817.  Blake, who received very few other engraving commissions during this period, was paid 5 guineas (\u00ce\u00a35.5s.) for each plate, a total of \u00ce\u00a3194.5s. plus \u00ce\u00a313.13s. as reimbursement for purchasing the copperplates (Longman's records, Bentley page 558).  Without the Hesiod project, Blake and his wife Catherine might have descended into dire poverty. Blake executed the Hesiod illustrations in an unusual graphic style.  Rather than continuous outlines, found in the engravings of Flaxman's other classical compositions, Blake used stippled lines\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthat is, lines composed of dots.  It is surprising to see Blake, who wrote in a letter of 1827 that \"a Line is a Line in its Minutest Subdivision[s]\" (Erdman page 783), deploying a technique that divides lines into points.  Perhaps he was responding to the character of Flaxman's preliminary drawings, now untraced, upon which the etchings/engravings were based.  If these were in soft pencil, then stippled lines would be an appropriate equivalent.  It is also possible that Flaxman or his publisher directed Blake to use this style. The texts accompanying the Hesiod designs were executed in continuous lines by a writing engraver named \"Jeffreys\" in Longman's accounts (Bentley page 557).  The quotations and paraphrases from Hesiod's poems are based on the second edition (1815) of The Remains of Hesiod, translated by Charles Abraham Elton.  Flaxman's classical compositions were influenced by, and often understood as recreations of, Greek and Etruscan vase paintings.  His illustrations of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey and of Dante's Divine Comedy were published, or at least engraved, in 1793.  They soon became famous and highly influential throughout Europe.  These were followed by designs for the tragedies of Aeschylus in 1795 and Blake's Hesiod engravings in 1817.  Blake also contributed three plates to the 1805 revised publication of the Iliad illustrations.  The Hesiod plates were frequently reprinted and included in The Classical Compositions of John Flaxman of 1870.  The publisher, Bell and Daldy, reportedly sold the copperplates as scrap metal in 1917 (Ruthven Todd, \"Blake's Dante Plates,\" Times Literary Supplement, 29 August 1968, page 928). ",

This slender plot is but a thread on which Blake hangs Oothoon's questionings of conventional morality. She insists on her inner purity and, in a long concluding lament to the \"Daughters of Albion,\" on the varieties of energetic self-expression that cannot be delimited by materialist philosophies or legalistic codes. The characters and their words represent Blake's critique of colonialism, slavery, sexual repression, and attitudes towards women in his day.The eleven plates of Visions were etched in relief, with slight touches of white-line work, and first printed in 1793.

The poem is in many respects a heterodox rewriting of Genesis, one in which the creation of the universe is seen as a fall into materiality and its abstract laws. The process is initiated by Urizen when he separates himself from his fellow \"Eternals\" and thereby creates difference, absence, and self-consciousness. As Urizen falls into this void of his own making, Los reacts by building a material and temporal base below which Urizen cannot descend. Through this narrative of ultimate origins, Blake explores fundamental epistemological and ontological issues.Blake etched in shallow relief the twenty-eight plates of The [First] Book of Urizen in 1794, although only copies A and B contain them all.

On the final plate, Thel comes to her grave and hears her own unanswered questions redolent with fears of both death and sexuality. This voice, and Thel's flight from it, indicate either her failure to accept the harsh facts of life or the failure of her interlocutors' philosophy to satisfy the human desire for transcendental truths.Blake etched The Book of Thel in relief, with a few touches of white-line work, on eight plates in 1789, the date on the title page, and 1790.

These impressions of the designs only from Blake\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds illuminated books were richly color printed, very probably in 1796, the date Blake wrote on an impression of The First Book of Urizen plate 1 in copy B of A Small Book of Designs. Copy A, now in the British Museum, was prepared for Humphry and passed from his collection to his son, William Upcott. Blake or his wife Catherine gathered the 23 impressions with string through three holes, the method they used in his illuminated books, but he did not number them; they may not constitute a sequential series but simply a gathering of beautifully color printed designs. When preparing the set of prints for Humphry in 1796, Blake apparently pulled a second impression of each plate (or at least of most of them) to build up his own stock of works. These impressions, now widely dispersed and eight not discovered until 2007, constitute most of copy B of A Small Book of Designs. The thinner color printing in the copy B impressions indicates that they are second pulls with little if any addition of color to the copperplates between pulls. Like those in copy A, these impressions were stabbed through three holes. Many years later, probably c. 1818 or later, Blake added pen and ink framing lines around the prints (similar to those in Songs copies R and V, both in the Archive), inscribed most of them with verse captions, and numbered them, apparently to indicate their order in a series. Blake had at least 22 numbered and framed impressions at one time, although subsequent treatment (or mistreatment) led to the erasure of some of the numbers and the trimming of the framing lines and captions.  Shared stab holes indicate that copy B was at one time bound, probably by Blake or his wife Catherine.

They are all full-page designs without text and thus could be incorporated into a group specifically printed without texts. In his 1818 letter to Turner, Blake explains, with a note of regret, that the color prints for Humphry were created \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdwith the Loss of some of the best things For they when Printed perfect accompany Poetical Personifications & Acts without which Poems they never could have been Executed\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd (Erdman page 771). Although the impressions in A Small Book of Designs are some of Blake\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds finest works as a color printer, their separation from the texts of the illuminated books sacrifices the interplay between words and images. Blake\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds attitude toward the Book of Designs when he produced them may have differed from his much later statements to Turner.

        "info": "When planning a third edition of his successful school text, The Pastorals of Virgil, Robert John Thornton employed Blake to contribute some of the new designs for the two-volume work.  Among his many other endeavors, Thornton was the physician for Blake's patron John Linnell, who probably played a key role in securing the commission.  Blake's assignment was to illustrate Ambrose Philips' English \"imitation\" of Virgil's first eclogue.Blake first produced four small designs (the same designs reproduced here as object 6) as relief etchings on a single copperplate, but this was rejected by Thornton.  There may have been several reasons, including the unconventional style of etching, the semi-nudity of some of the figures, and the difficulties letterpress printers would have encountered with such an unusual matrix.  Apparently Blake was asked to prepare wood engravings, a medium in which he had never before worked, instead of relief etchings.  He executed a series of at least twenty-one pen, pencil, and wash drawings; these were probably approved by Thornton.  The wood engravings that Blake produced from them, however, were far less conventional.  Thornton was again taken aback by Blake's bold transgression of contemporary styles and sensibilities.  Several influential artists, including Linnell and Sir Thomas Lawrence, commended Blake's work; their opinions convinced Thornton to print them in his 1821 edition (objects 5-8, 10).  Three designs (object 9) were engraved by a journeyman for the sake of comparison with Blake's own productions in wood, and Thornton added a statement below Blake's first design (object 5) implying his own hesitations about Blake's artistry.  Pre-publication proofs of Blake's wood engravings show that each group of four were cut on a single block; these were cut apart, slightly reduced in size on all four sides, and printed with brief letterpress captions.  This format, as published in Thornton's Virgil, is preserved in our reproductions.In addition to his original wood engravings, Blake contributed six copperplate intaglio engravings picturing famous classical figures (objects 1-4, 12, 13).  He also executed a reduced drawing, perhaps directly on the woodblock, based on a painting by Nicolas Poussin.  This was cut in the block by John Byfield (object 11).  All these materials are included in our reproductions.Twenty of Blake's preliminary drawings, all executed in monochrome wash, were sold at auction from the Linnell collection in 1918.

The present ownership of each drawing is given in the Editors' Notes for the relevant wood engravings (objects 6-10).  Blake's original woodblocks are in the British Museum.Although small in size and almost rejected by the man who commissioned them, Blake's Virgil wood engravings have been among his most influential works.  The young artists who gathered around Blake in his final years, including Samuel Palmer, George Richmond, and Edward Calvert, were deeply inspired by the Virgil engravings.

        "info": "When planning a third edition of his successful school text, The Pastorals of Virgil, Robert John Thornton employed Blake to contribute some of the new designs for the two-volume work.  Among his many other endeavors, Thornton was the physician for Blake\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds patron John Linnell, who probably played a key role in securing the commission.

There may have been several reasons, including the unconventional style of etching, the semi-nudity of some of the figures, and the difficulties letterpress printers would have encountered with such an unusual matrix.  Apparently Blake was asked to prepare wood engravings, a medium in which he had never before worked, instead of relief etchings.  He executed a series of at least twenty-one pen, pencil, and wash drawings; these were probably approved by Thornton.  The wood engravings that Blake produced from them, however, were far less conventional.  Thornton was again taken aback by Blake\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds bold transgression of contemporary styles and sensibilities.  Several influential artists, including Linnell and Sir Thomas Lawrence, commended Blake\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds work; their opinions convinced Thornton to print them in his 1821 edition.  Three designs were engraved by a journeyman for the sake of comparison with Blake\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds own productions in wood, and Thornton added a statement below Blake\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds first design implying his own hesitations about Blake\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds artistry.We present here a selection of Blake\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds preliminary drawings.  Twenty of these were sold at auction from the Linnell collection in 1918.  These are now widely dispersed.  The present ownership of each drawing reproduced here is recorded on the Work Information page.  Seven drawings are untraced and one drawing in the Linnell group (Butlin 769.4) was not engraved.

According to Blake\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds letter to Hayley of 22 June 1804, Flaxman had suggested that this painting should be engraved for Hayley\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Life of Romney (Erdman pages 752-53). Blake sent Hayley the preparatory drawing with his letter of 16 July 1804 (Erdman page 753) and, in an untraced letter from Hayley, received permission to begin the engraving. Blake spent the rest of the year working sporadically on the print and keeping Hayley regularly updated on his progress. In his letter of 7 August 1804, Blake informs his patron that he is working on the engraving and in his letter of 28 September 1804 states that he will soon send Hayley a proof (Erdman pages 754-55). He makes similar statements on 23 October and 4 December, before finally sending a proof with his letter to Hayley of 18 December 1804 (Edman pages 756-58).

The first two volumes were published in 1803 and the third the following year. The work contains six plates, all signed by Blake as the engraver. Blake also signed one plate, known as \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdThe Weather House\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd (object 4) as the designer, although the roundel in the lower portion of the design picturing three hares was probably based on a design by George Romney. Blake\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds work on these engravings was scrutinized by members of Hayley\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds circle, notably Cowper\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds cousin, Lady Harriet Hesketh, and their criticisms may have led to some of the friction that appears in Blake\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds relationship with Hayley from 1801 onward.  The plates for Hayley\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds biography of Cowper constitute one of the first commissions Blake worked on during his three-year sojourn on the West Sussex coast. In a letter to Thomas Butts of 11 September 1801, Blake states that his \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdPrincipal labour at this time is Engraving Plates for Cowpers Life\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd (Erdman page 716). Writing to his brother James two years later, on 30 January 1803, Blake states that his wife Catherine \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdhas undertaken to Print the whole number of the Plates for [the first two volumes of] Cowpers work\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd (Erdman page 726). Blake made two drawings of Cowper after Romney\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds portrait of the poet.  These were the basis for two miniature paintings of Cowper and the portrait engraving that is the frontispiece for Hayley\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds biography (object 1). There are also four drawings of the designs for Cowper\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds funeral monument that Blake produced at Hayley\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds request in 1802.  The first two drawings are Hayley\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds first idea for the monument and were sent to John Flaxman who was commissioned to sculpt the monument. The third drawing revises Hayley\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds first idea and was the basis from Flaxman\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds finished monument as well as Blake\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds engraving, which was published in the third volume of Hayley\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds biography (object 6).

Epistolary evidence indicates that Blake was responsible for the unsigned plate.  By the end of 1799, Hayley was hurrying to prepare the poem for publication before the death of his terminally ill son, Thomas Alphonso Hayley. In a letter to Flaxman of 21 December, Hayley states \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI wish to have only the two following Decorations, if you approve them\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bda Frontispiece & a vignette at the close\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthe first from poor Toms outline of Demosthenes at the base of Neptunes Statue . . . & a neat small Head, as a closing vignette, from your medallion of the dear disciple [Thomas Hayley]\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd (Bentley, Records page 85). In January 1800, Blake had been commissioned to execute these engravings (objects 2 and 3), probably through the recommendation of Flaxman. In addition, Blake engraved the bust of Pericles after a drawing by Tom Hayley that became the frontispieces in the published work.  With his letter of 1 April 1800, Blake sent Hayley a proof of the medallion of Tom Hayley (Erdman page 705). On 17 April, Hayley responded with some criticisms of the proof and, after his son\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds death on 2 May, invited Blake to Felpham to complete the engraving (Bentley, Records pages 87-88, 90). Blake spent at least three weeks working beside Hayley in Felpham during July 1800. He completed both a half-length drawing of Thomas Alphonso and the engraving of the medallion portrait (object 3). Later that year, after Blake had relocated to Sussex, he painted a series of 18 portrait heads to decorate Hayley\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds library, including portraits of Thomas Alphonso and Demosthenes.

The child is the chief representative of this condition; other recurrent figures, such as the shepherd and lamb, point ultimately to the figure of Christ as the incarnation of the unity of innocence. In a few poems, the rhetoric, irony, and divided consciousness of experience begin to insinuate themselves into the landscape of innocence. In 1794, Blake combined Innocence with its contrary companion, the Songs of Experience, to create the combined Songs of Innocence and of Experience.Blake etched the Songs of Innocence in relief, with white-line work in some designs, on thirty-one plates in 1789, the date on the title page. The first printing, also of 1789, produced sixteen (or possibly seventeen) copies: U (black ink) and possibly untraced copy V; I, J, X, and \"Innocence\" of Songs of innocence and of Experience copy F (green ink); A-H, K-M, Z (yellow ochre or raw sienna ink). In addition, the \"Innocence\" section of what would later become Songs of Innocence and of Experience copies B-E were printed in this first session. After 1794, the printing history of Innocence becomes complex because Blake began printing it with Experience to form copies of the combined Songs while continuing also to issue Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience separately. Complicating matters further are the facts that some separately issued copies of Innocence were combined with Experience by collectors and dealers, and that copies of Innocence now separate were once part of copies of the combined Songs.In 1795, Blake printed both sections of Songs of Innocence and of Experience copies A and R. In a separate print-run of the same year, he printed eight sets of Innocence and nine sets of Experience impressions to form Innocence copy N, the \"Innocence\" section of combined Songs copy J, the \"Experience\" section of combined Songs copies J, O, and S, and both sections of combined Songs I, L, M, and BB. The \"Innocence\" section of combined Songs copy O was once joined with the \"Experience\" section of combined Songs copy K; untraced Innocence copy W was probably once joined with the \"Experience\" section of combined Songs copy N. In c. 1802, Blake printed three copies of Songs of Innocence (O, R and Y printed as a single copy and later divided into incomplete copies, and the \"Innocence\" section of combined Songs copy P), along with two copies of Experience (the \"Experience\" sections of Songs of Innocence and of Experience copies P and Q). In c. 1804, he printed another three copies of Songs of Innocence (P, Q, and the \"Innocence\" section of combined Songs copy Q); in c. 1811 he printed two more copies (Innocence copy S and the \"Innocence\" section of combined Songs copy S). This was the last time Blake printed Songs of Innocence separately. Songs of Innocence copy T is posthumous, with hand coloring in imitation of copy B. No two copies of Songs of Innocence share the same arrangement of the plates.Between 1818 and 1827, Blake always printed Innocence and Experience as parts of the combined Songs. In seven of the eight copies produced, the plate order remained the same (see Songs of Innocence and of Experience).",

As he told John Flaxman in a letter of 12 September 1800, \"Milton lovd me in childhood & shewd me his face\" (Erdman page 707). Several early drawings, such as the Satan, Sin, and Death of c. 1780 (Butlin 101), were probably inspired by Milton. In 1790-92, Blake loosely sketched several illustrations to Paradise Lost in his Notebook (Butlin 201; see Related Works, below). He composed his first series of water colors illustrating one of Milton's poems in 1801 when the Rev. Joseph Thomas commissioned eight designs for Comus (Butlin 527). Thomas later acquired (very probably on commission) a set of twelve water color illustrations to Paradise Lost in 1807 (Butlin 529) and six water colors illustrating \"On the Morning of Christ's Nativity\" in 1809 (Butlin 538). Between 1808 and 1815, Blake produced similar (but not in every respect identical) sets of the Paradise Lost and \"Nativity\" designs for Thomas Butts (Butlin 529, 542), to which he added the twelve illustrations to \"L'Allegro\" and \"Il Penseroso\" c. 1816-20 (Butlin 543) presented here. Although we can be confident that Butts was the first owner of these illustrations and very probably commissioned them, there are no extant records of such a commission.

        "info": " Upon arriving in Felpham on the Sussex coast in 1800, one of the first commissions Blake received from his new patron, William Hayley, was the broadside ballad Little Tom the Sailor. According to his Memoirs, Hayley composed the poem on 22 September 1800 \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdto relieve the necessities of a meritorious poor Woman on the Kentish coast\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd (Bentley, Records, pages 99-100). In a letter to Thomas Butts of 23 September, Blake states, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI have begun to Work & find \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd_ that Felpham is propitious to the Arts\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd (Erdman page 711). Blake was almost certainly referring to Little Tom the Sailor, which comprises head and tailpiece designs on separate plates, etched and engraved in white line, and the texts of Hayley\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds ballad and a colophon etched in relief on two copperplates.  Hayley probably gave Blake the ballad to etch on the day of its composition or shortly thereafter. The ballad was published, according to the colophon, on 5 October 1800. It therefore took Blake approximately thirteen days to relief etch the texts as well as design and execute the two illustrations. A preliminary sketch of the headpiece is in the Victoria and Albert Museum. To print the ballad, Blake placed his four plates one above the other in his rolling press and printed them on one leaf of paper. By the end of the November 1800, the initial print run appears to have almost sold out. In a letter to Hayley of 26 November, Blake, referring to the ballad, claims, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdwe can muster a few in colours and some in black which I hope will be no less favour\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd tho\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd they are rough like rough sailors\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd (Erdman page 714).

Heavily indebted to Alexander Pope\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds The Rape of the Lock, Hayley\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds didactic poem seeks to teach adolescent girls to become accomplished wives by exercising their temper.  The sixth edition of the poem, published in 1788, was the first to be illustrated; it contains seven plates after designs by Thomas Stothard. In 1803, Hayley commissioned Blake to engrave a series of new illustrations based on designs by  John Flaxman\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds half-sister, Maria Flaxman, for a twelfth edition of the poem. She produced seven designs, of which Blake engraved six. Blake worked on these plates for the first six months of 1803. In his letter to Thomas Butts of 10 January 1803, Blake reports that he was \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdnow engaged in Engraving 6 small plates for a New Edition of Mr Hayleys Triumphs of Temper. from drawings by Maria Flaxman sister to my friend the Sculptor\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd (Erdman page 723). At the end of the month, on 30 January, Blake informs his brother James of the commission and state that he would be paid \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd10 G[uineas]\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd for each plate (Erdman page 726). By the end of June, the engravings were evidently complete, for Hayley sent a copy of the twelfth edition to Lady Harriet Hesketh, William Cowper\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds cousin. In a letter of 1 July, she tells Hayley of her disappointment with the prints. In a letter to John Flaxman of 7 August 1803, Hayley, presumably referring to Hesketh\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds comments, states: \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI am sorry to say that the Ladies (& it is a Ladys Book) find fault with the Engravings\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd our poor industrious Blake has received sixty Guineas for them from my Bookseller & I believe both the artist & the paymaster are dissatisfied on the occasion\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd (Bentley, Records page 157). In the same letter, Hayley also reports that he and Blake made the decision to omit from the engravings the figure of Minerva represented in one of Maria Flaxman\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds original designs. In response, John Flaxman remarked in a letter to Hayley of 24 August 1803 that one of his half-sister\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds drawings depicting \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdSerena viewing herself in the Glass when dressed for the Masquerade whilst her Maid adjusts her train\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd was overlooked for engraving (Bentley, Records page 166).Two of Maria Flaxman\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds original designs were on display at the Royal Academy annual exhibition in 1800. All seven drawings were sold at auction at Christie\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds on 26 February 1883. These are currently untraced.    Blake\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds engravings were repeated in a very small print run of the thirteenth edition of The Triumphs of Temper, published in 1807. The copperplates had worn significantly and were replaced by the original engravings after designs by Stothard in another 1807 issue of the poem. ",

        "info": "A complete copy of Songs of Innocence and of Experience contains fifty-four plates etched in relief with touches of white-line work in a few designs. Plate a (a tailpiece probably etched in the late 1780s) appears only in copies B-D of the combined Songs; plate b (\"A Divine Image\") appears only in copy BB of the combined Songs among those printed by Blake. Plates 34-36, 53, and 54 were first published in Innocence but moved to Experience in 1794, 1795, and 1818 respectively.The printing history of the combined Songs is complicated because Blake printed it while also continuing to print Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience separately, and because some copies of the combined Songs were assembled by collectors or dealers from copies of Innocence and Experience separately issued, while other copies now consist of only one section. The separately issued copies of Innocence are listed under Songs of Innocence, while the few separate and separately issued copies of Experience are listed below. Experience was first printed while it was still a work in progress; seventeen of the plates were color printed in c. 1794 and now make up Songs copies F, G, H, and T1-2. The first copies of the combined Songs were B, C, and D, formed in 1794 from copies of Innocence printed in 1789 and copies of the complete Experience printed in 1794. Combined Songs copy E also consists mostly of impressions from these print runs, but appears to have been assembled or at least recolored c. 1806 for Blake's patron Thomas Butts.The first copies of the combined Songs in which the two sections were printed together were A and R in 1795. That same year, Blake printed eight sets of Innocence and nine sets of Experience impressions to form Innocence copy N, the \"Innocence\" section of combined Songs copy J, the \"Experience\" sections of combined Songs copies J, O, and S, and both sections of combined Songs copies I, L, M, and BB. \"Innocence\" of combined Songs copy O was once joined with \"Experience\" of combined Songs copy K, and untraced Innocence copy W was probably once combined with \"Experience\" of combined Songs copy N. In c. 1802, Blake printed three copies of Innocence (O, R and Y printed as a single copy and later divided into two incomplete copies, and the \"Innocence\" section of combined Songs copy P), along with two copies of Experience (the \"Experience\" sections of combined Songs copies P and Q). In c. 1804, he printed another three copies of Innocence (P, Q, and the \"Innocence\" section of combined Songs copy Q); in c. 1811 he printed two more copies (Innocence copy S and the \"Innocence\" section of combined Songs copy S).Between 1818 and 1827, Innocence and Experience were always printed as part of the combined Songs. In c. 1818, Blake printed combined Songs copies T2 and U; in c. 1821, copy V; in 1825, copies W and Y; in 1826, copies Z and AA; and in 1827, copy X. In all but copy V, the plate order is the same, though copy T2 has had plate 49 repositioned and a few Innocence poems replaced with earlier impressions. The plate order in these last copies and in \"Innocence\" of combined Songs copy S (c. 1811) follows, with minor variations, the plate order of combined Songs copy R, which was Blake's personal copy until he sold it to John Linnell in 1819. The coloring of combined Songs copies K and M is posthumous.",

        "info": "Perhaps drawing on a literary tradition of moon-voyage or flight narratives, Blake sets the earliest extended manifestation of his penchant for satire \"In the Moon\" on a \"certain Island\" with \"some affinity to England\" (object 1, page 1, Erdman page 449), which provides the domestic settings\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdstudy, parlor, garden\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdfor a boisterous sendup of middle class London social and intellectual life distilled into eleven brief chapters of \"Great confusion & disorder\" (object 10). The use of dialogue interspersed with song lyrics links An Island in the Moon to both contemporary theatrical forms and broader eighteenth-century traditions of satirical narrative. Blake\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds experiences in the London social circle of the Rev. A. S. Mathew and his wife Harriet in the 1780s may be the main inspiration for these mocking reflections, which feature impertinent, passionate, confrontational characters, some if not all derived from Blake\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds contemporaries. The philosopher-trio Suction the Epicurean, Quid the Cynic (perhaps Robert and William Blake), and Sipsop the Pythagorean join such companions as Inflammable Gass the Wind Finder, Obtuse Angle, and Mrs. Nannicantipot in a swirl of idle gossip, recitation, rude joking, drunken singing, and passionate wrangling about topics of current interest: \"Fissic Follogy, Pistinology[,] . . . Hogamy HAtomy, & hall that\" (object 5). The resulting disarray, bordering on farce \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\"O ay come Ill sing you a song said the Cynic. the trumpeter shit in his hat said the Epicurean\" (object 3) \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd is a self-undermining scramble that deflates nearly every pretense to lyricism or serious thought. Blake, writing in his mid to late 20s, demonstrates a born satirist\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds instincts for the ridiculous. Though satire is never entirely absent from the illuminated books, only in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell (1790) is it the dominant mode. An Island in the Moon underscores the importance of the extensive stretches of humor and satire that show up frequently among his other writings. So, although Blake left it orphaned, untitled, and unfinished in a heavily revised manuscript, Island is in some sense a primary literary experiment for him, setting the undertone of much to follow.Island is an incomplete manuscript written in pen and ink in Blake\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds hand. It notably contains the earliest extant drafts of \"Nurse\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Song,\" \"HOLY THURSDAY,\" and \"The Little Boy Lost,\" which make their first published appearance in his Songs of Innocence (1789). The history of Blake\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds associations with the Mathew circle, along with topical allusions to balloon hats\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bda short-lived fashion associated with early demonstrations of ballooning\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdand the performing monkey General Jacko, suggest a period of composition c. 1784-85. Before the manuscript was given to the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1905, two or more leaves may have been removed, stranding the passage (\". . . them Illuminating the Manuscript . . .\") that begins abruptly on object 17. The contents of a final page of lettering and rough sketches (object 18) seem unrelated to the text of Island. The sketches and lettering on the verso of object 18 may reflect Robert Blake's attempts to draw subjects that had been set as exercises for him by older brother William, and, in some instances, corrected by one of them (see the Object Note under Editors' Notes for object 18).

        "info": "Blake divided this series of aphoristic declarations and accompanying emblem-like designs into two groups of numbered propositions, designated by modern editors as \"series a\" and \"series b.\" In the first, Blake states basic principles, derived from the philosophy of John Locke and his followers, about physical perception, reason, and the limits of knowledge. The second series redefines and confutes the first and argues for the infinitude of spiritual perceptions. Shared graphic styles, themes, and genre closely associate There is No Natural Religion with All Religions are One.Blake etched the work in relief on twenty small plates c. 1788. A few designs show touches of white-line work. Impressions of only nineteen plates are now extant; no impression is known from the plate that presumably bore proposition \"III\" in series b. Only two printings are known. The first, c. 1794, is an abridgement consisting of twelve plates (a1-9; b3, 4, 12). These show rudimentary color printing and hand tinting on some plates. This printing is represented by copies A-D, G, and M, although later extractions and additions in some of these copies have obscured Blake's intentions for his abridgement, in which the Lockean principles of series a are directly refuted by the three plates from series b. The second printing (1795) contains ten plates from series b (b1, 3, 4, 6, 7-12) plus the title page from series a (a2). Only a single large-paper copy (L), printed as a companion to the large-paper copy (A) of All Religions are One, plus a few loose pulls, are known from this printing. It too shows rudimentary color printing. At a much later date, probably no earlier than 1818, Blake added pen and ink framing lines to copy L.",

        "info": " J. G. Stedman's Narrative contains a frontispiece to volume 1, an engraved vignette on the title page of each of the two volumes, and eighty numbered full-page plates (including three maps).  Thirteen of the numbered plates are signed by Blake; a further three unsigned plates (7, 12, and 14) have been attributed to Blake by modern scholars.  As both title pages indicate, the full-page plates are based on drawings by Stedman.  None of the drawings on which Blake based his engravings has been traced, but it is likely that Blake made various minor alterations in Stedman's amateur designs. Blake began work on the Stedman plates in 1791.  Stedman visited Blake in June 1794 and subsequently the engraver helped the author with various business matters, very probably including negotiations with the book's publisher, Joseph Johnson.  Blake's attitudes towards slavery and colonialism were indebted to Stedman's autobiographical narrative, as is particularly evident in the texts and designs of his illuminated books Visions of the Daughters of Albion and America, both dated 1793.  Stedman's relationship with a female slave, Joanna, may have influenced Blake's complex representations of gender and sexuality. Most, possibly all, of the large-paper copies issued in 1796 have hand-colored plates that include touches of liquefied gold and silver.  This tinting was very probably executed by anonymous commercial colorists hired by Johnson.  A second edition was issued in 1806 and reprinted in 1813.  Some copies of these two later issues also have hand-colored plates, but in a style different from the 1796 coloring. ",

        "info": "The poetry of John Milton was important to Blake as both poet and artist from his earliest years. As he told John Flaxman in a letter of 12 September 1800, \"Milton lovd me in childhood & shewd me his face\" (Erdman page 707). Several early drawings, such as the Satan, Sin, and Death of c. 1780 (Butlin 101), were probably inspired by Milton. In 1790-92, Blake loosely sketched several illustrations to Paradise Lost in his Notebook (Butlin 201; see Related Works, below). He composed his first series of water colors illustrating one of Milton's poems in 1801 when the Rev. Joseph Thomas commissioned eight designs for Comus (Butlin 527). In 1809, Blake produced for Thomas a  set of six illustrations to Milton's \"On the Morning of Christ's Nativity\" (Butlin 538). Blake repeated the same basic \"Nativity Ode\" designs, with many minor but intriguing variations, for his main patron, Thomas Butts, in about 1815 (Butlin 542).  This later series is presented here. The date is based on stylistic considerations--see the Note following Composition Date on the Work Information page.  When sold at auction in 1852, the water colors were accompanied by the poem, or possibly only the passages illustrated, in manuscript.  This now-lost text may have been written by Blake,  like the transcriptions in his hand of the passages illustrated still with his \"L'Allegro\" and \"Il Penseroso\" illustrations (Butlin 543).Blake's interest in the \"Nativity Ode\" began long before his execution of the Thomas set of water colors. His illuminated book, Europe a Prophecy (1794), clearly shows the influence of Milton's ode. By 1809, Blake may have taken a renewed interest in the poem because of his increasingly Christocentric theological views. His harsh criticism of classical civilization resonates with two of the \"Nativity\" designs, \"The Old Dragon\" and \"The Overthrow of Apollo and the Pagan Gods\" (objects 3 and 4). Modern critics have been hard pressed to find Blake dissenting from Milton's own iconography and perspectives in the ode.Blake's literary response to the life and works of John Milton finds its fullest expression in the illuminated book Milton a Poem.",

        "info": "One of Blake's two final epics, Milton follows the titular hero in a journey of self-discovery and renewal. In the poem's first \"Book,\" John Milton returns from heaven to the mortal world and unites with the imagination through the person of William Blake. Together, they set out to reconfigure the relationship between a living poet and a great predecessor. In the second and final book, Milton unites with his feminine aspect, Ololon, in progress towards the apocalyptic overcoming of divisions between the sexes, between the living and the dead, and between human consciousness and its alienated projections into the external world. This plot is integrated with expansive references and allusions that range from the Bible to Blake's own life, particularly the difficult relationship with his patron William Hayley. Portions of The Four Zoas, Blake's long manuscript poem, are repeated (often with little revision) in Milton.Blake etched forty-five plates for Milton in relief, with some full-page designs in white-line etching, between c. 1804 (the date on the title page) and c. 1811. Six additional plates (a-f) were probably etched in subsequent years up to 1818. No copy contains all fifty-one plates. The prose \"Preface\" (plate 2) appears only in copies A and B. Plates a-e appear only in copies C and D, plate f only in copy D. The first printing, late in 1810 or early in 1811, produced copies A-C. Blake retained copy C and added new plates and rearranged others at least twice; the volume was not finished until c. 1821. Copy D was printed in 1818. As a partly masked white-line inscription on the title page suggests, Blake may have originally planned to write twelve \"Books\" for Milton.",

The American Revolution is viewed as a harbinger of universal revolution, epistemological as much as political.In 1793, Blake etched in relief, with considerable white-line work in some designs, and first printed twenty-three plates for America. These include eighteen major text and design plates used in all complete copies, a small plate (e) bearing the word \"Preludium\" and printed above the design on plate 3, and four plates (a-d) never published, perhaps because of potentially actionable references to \"the King\" and \"George.\" The first printing consisted of proof copy a (plates 1, 4, 11, 12, 15, a-c in black, dark green, and dark blue inks), copies E-G, I, K, L in greenish black or dark olive inks, and copies C, D, H, R in bluish black and blue green inks (there is no copy designated as \"J\").

        "info": "The 116 water-color illustrations to Thomas Gray's poems are among Blake's major achievements as an illustrator. They were commissioned in 1797 by Blake's friend, the sculptor John Flaxman, as a gift for his wife Ann, to whom Blake addressed the poem that ends the series. The commission may have been inspired by the Flaxmans' seeing Blake's water-color designs to Edward Young's Night Thoughts, begun in 1795. The Gray illustrations follow the same basic format. Blake cut windows in large sheets of the same type of Whatman paper used for the Night Thoughts illustrations and mounted in these windows the texts of Gray's poems from a 1790 octavo edition published by John Murray, leaving out some prefatory materials, fly-titles, the notes, and the 7 engraved illustrations. Blake then drew and colored his designs surrounding the letterpress texts. On blank versos near the beginning of each poem, and in one case on a separate piece of paper pasted over letterpress text, Blake inscribed with pen and ink either titles for each design or quotations from the poem to indicate the passage illustrated. On most text pages, Blake also drew a pencil cross left of the first line of the illustrated passage. He numbered most leaves consecutively in pen and ink, beginning a new sequence for each of the 13 poems.Blake conceived of his work as an illustrated book, rather than a series of unbound designs, as indicated by his offsetting Gray's texts above and to the right (left on versos) from the middle of each leaf--then the convention for all letterpress books. Although listed by William Michael Rossetti in his catalogue of Blake's drawings and paintings, published in the 1863 and 1880 editions of Alexander Gilchrist's Life of William Blake, the Gray illustrations were virtually unknown until their rediscovery by Herbert Grierson in 1919.Blake's illustrations respond to Gray's poems in a variety of ways, but always with respect for the specifics in the text. Many motifs are visualizations--and hence literalizations--of Gray's metaphoric images. The Gray illustrations share iconographic and stylistic similarities with the Night Thoughts designs; both series are indebted to the pictorial imagery Blake developed in his illuminated books of the early- and mid-1790s. For the more comic passages in Gray's poems, Blake deployed a broad, almost caricature-like style. Many of the designs emphasize the imagination at work in the world through inspired acts of reading, writing, and performing music. ",

        "info": "An intriguing glimpse of the Pickering Manuscript poems surfaces on 16 August 1803, the month before Blake's return to London after three years in Felpham, Sussex. The increasingly miserable artist-in-residence for William Hayley writes his London friend and patron Thomas Butts a letter that attempts to give some \"Picture of my Present state I pray God to keep you & all men from it & to deliver me in his own good time.\" Blake's verbal self-portrait culminates in three stanzas that open with an exclamatory couplet: \"O why was I born with a different face / Why was I not born like the rest of my race\" (Erdman pages 733-34).            He varied that couplet only slightly in the separate poem \"Mary,\" which may have been composed around the same time. At some point he copied \"Mary\" neatly into a 22-page manuscript with nine other poems, seven known from no other source. Not earlier than 1802, probably after the abandonment of the quarto Ballads project in 1805 (see Blake's letter to William Hayley, 22 January 1805, Erdman pages 762-63), Blake reutilized paper that had been used in Hayley's Designs to a Series of Ballads, 1802 (to which Blake had contributed engraved illustrations), trimmed off Hayley's printed texts (and with them the 1802 watermark), and on the spacious inside margins wrote out the ten poems that constitute the Pickering Manuscript\u00ef\u00be\u008a\u00ef\u00be\u0097\u00ef\u00be\u0094named after B. M. Pickering (1836-1878), one of its several nineteenth century owners.The poems may have been composed from about 1800 through perhaps 1804 (see Bentley, Blake Books pages 341-42). In the final manuscript version, the clarity and formality of the hand, the neatness and uniformity of the arrangement, the scarcity of changes, and even the number of poems tantalizingly suggest a specific occasion for the collection. But there are no designs, no title page, and no concrete evidence to indicate whether Blake intended some form of publication or, perhaps, as David Erdman suggests, made the collection for a friend or patron (Erdman page 859n). If so, that friend or patron never received it. It remained with Blake's wife Catherine after his death in 1827. The poems were not published until 1866\u00ef\u00be\u008a\u00ef\u00be\u0097\u00ef\u00be\u0094the year Pickering bought the manuscript\u00ef\u00be\u008a\u00ef\u00be\u0097\u00ef\u00be\u0094in Songs of Innocence and Experience, with Other Poems, edited by R. H. Shepherd.In attempts to capture the character of the collection in a title, it has also been called the Ballads Manuscript (Bentley) and the Auguries Manuscript (Johnson and Grant). Its sometimes ballad-like poems range in length from sixteen lines in four stanzas reminiscent of the Songs of Innocence and of Experience (\"The Smile\") to one undivided sequence of 132 aphoristic lines (\"Auguries of Innocence\"), with the other poems at various lengths in between. All have, in one way or another, strong precedents in earlier work\u00ef\u00be\u008a\u00ef\u00be\u0097\u00ef\u00be\u0094characteristic subject matter, ideology, and attitude; ballad- and hymn-like structures built upon characteristic rhythms, rhymes, and repetitions; a striking penchant (and talent) for aphorism and invented proverb; and strong ironies in strange mixtures of story and saying, among other familiar traits. No one who has read the Songs and the Proverbs of Hell in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell will fail to recognize the poetic neighborhood of the Pickering Manuscript as Blake's.But he must have sensed that these were ten instances of particularly masterful\u00ef\u00be\u008a\u00ef\u00be\u0097\u00ef\u00be\u0094refined, powerful, compelling, inspired\u00ef\u00be\u008a\u00ef\u00be\u0097\u00ef\u00be\u0094poetry underwritten by an increasingly codified mythology. Thus one of the most elegant and memorable narratives of the Pickering group, \"The Mental Traveller,\" is the kind of poem that has helped give Blake the reputation of an artist who \"must Create a System, or be enslav'd by another Mans\" (as his hero Los says in Jerusalem plate 10, Erdman page 153). Like some other poems in the group, \"The Mental Traveller\" comes across as a module that Blake could easily have slipped into his more extended mythopoeic ventures. It encapsulates with extraordinary concision a smooth, dark core of Blake's storytelling: \"She lives upon his shrieks & cries / And She grows young as he grows old\" (object 3). Like most of the poems in this grouping, \"The Mental Traveller\" is sharp but enigmatic, as if it can simultaneously know precisely what it is about but remain baffling to readers who want to crack its code.Then again, the manuscript also beckons to readers (and poets, artists, and musicians, because these are among Blake's most influential lines) who want light with their darkness\u00ef\u00be\u008a\u00ef\u00be\u0097\u00ef\u00be\u0094who prefer their unsparing social insights balanced against hope and healing. This attractive, popular Blake is best represented here in the long aphoristic sequence \"Auguries of Innocence,\" where \"under every grief & pine / Runs a joy with silken twine,\" \"Man was made for Joy & Woe,\" and it is possible \"To see a World in a Grain of Sand / And a Heaven in a Wild Flower / Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand / And Eternity in an hour\" (object 16). Miraculous acts of imagination can be achieved even in a world where \"The Harlots cry from Street to Street / Shall weave Old Englands winding Sheet\" (object 18) and \"The Babe that weeps the Rod beneath / Writes Revenge in realms of death\" (object 16).",
