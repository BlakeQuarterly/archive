                "#text": "The subject of the design may be Genesis 5:22: \"And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.\"  A low dais or plinth consisting of two steps runs most of the way across the bottom of this design, from the lower left corner nearly to the lower right corner.  It forms a kind of stage for the scene.  Four tree trunks rise at regular intervals above the dais, starting from the left edge of the design and proceeding to the right edge of the dais.  Each tree bears a leafy canopy just visible below the upper edge of the design.  Vines climb the three rightmost trees.  Indeterminate, perhaps leafy vegetation fills much of the space between the two leftmost tree trunks.  Between the three leftmost trunks a distant landscape of low grassy hills is visible.  A lake may be located just below the hills, and a near bank below that.  Wash above the hills, between the third and fourth trees, and to the right of the fourth tree suggests the sky.  An old man, apparently Enoch, is seated near the center of the design, on a kind of dais.  His body faces forward, with his bent knees out toward the viewer.  He turns his head to the right and tilts it back slightly, so that his face is visible in profile looking up to the right.  His slightly bent left arm is forward, and he rests his left hand on his right knee.  His bent right arm is also drawn forward, and he grasps one edge of a book loosely with this hand.  The opposite edge of the book is propped against the folds of his garment on his right thigh; his left hand may also help to support the book.  The old man casts a dark shadow on the dais to the right.  To the left of the old man reclines a young woman, probably one of Enoch's daughters.  Her lower body extends to the left along a bench or couch, and the shape of her garments suggests that her bent right leg may be crossed over her left.  She twists her upper body forward at the waist and rests against a pillow or similar support to the right, visible beneath the old man's right elbow.  Her right arm is down and bent across her torso.  She turns her head slightly to the right.  A young man, probably one of Enoch's sons, rests in a similar position just to the left of her.  Two children sit between them.  The man's lower body extends to the left, but he twists at the waist so that his torso faces forward.  He turns his head right so that his face is visible in profile.  The man wears a long gown and has long curly hair.  His right arm is bent and drawn forward, and rests on the right shoulder of the foremost child, a girl.  The girl's shoulders face forward though she turns her head slightly right.  Her right upper arm is extended down to the left, while her left upper arm is down.  She has long hair and wears a shirt or gown.  The rightmost child is a boy whose head and left shoulder are visible to the right of the leftmost child.  The boy's shoulder faces forward, but he turns his head to the right.  He has short curly hair, and may be nude.  The partly erased head and upper body of an additional figure appears, facing right, above and slightly to the left of the head of the female just left of Enoch.  The couch on which the four people sit extends to the left.  Shadow fills the area beneath the couch.  Two youths stand together near the left edge of the design.  One is slightly to the left of the other, and partially hides his companion.  The leftmost youth faces right and rests his weight on his right leg, which is planted on the lower step of the dais; his left leg is bent forward and drawn up, and his left foot rests on tiptoe on a higher step.  His right arm is down by his side but drawn forward slightly.  He holds an object, perhaps a book, in his right hand.  He is nude with visible genitals and has long curly hair.  The partly hidden youth to the right stands on the highest step of the dais, facing forward, but turns his head to the right.  His left arm is by his side and seems to be bent behind his back at the elbow.  He may be nude or may wear a short tunic.  He has short curly hair.  A grouping of five angels is visible at the right side of the design.  The foremost angel hovers or flies facing forward and left, but turns his head farther left so that his face is seen in profile looking left.  His left arm is down by his side and bent forward at the elbow, and he holds one corner of a piece of paper, possibly a scroll, with his left hand.  The angel wears a gown or tunic draped over his right shoulder, leaving his torso partly nude.  His mouth is slightly open and his long hair flies behind his head.  He partially hides a second angel, whose head, right arm, and right shoulder are just visible above and to the left of the first.  This second angel's right shoulder may face partly forward, but his head faces left and is bent down slightly.  He has short curly hair, and may be nude or may wear a gown or tunic.  His slightly bent right arm is extended forward from his body at roughly 135 degrees and he holds the other end of the large paper with this hand.  Marks on the paper suggest a text, possibly Hebrew letters.  The third angel from the right in the front group of three, who is partly hidden by the other two, stands or hovers facing forward and slightly left.  This angel's slightly bent right arm is extended and drawn across his torso to the right; it is hidden below the elbow.  His right leg, visible below the paper the two foremost angels hold, seems similarly to extend down to the right.  He has short curly hair and may have a small mustache.  The heads and shoulders of two more angels appear together in the upper right corner.  Of these, the shoulders of the angel on the right face left, but he turns his head away so that his face is not visible.  He partially hides the angel on the left, whose left shoulder seems to face away though he turns his head back towards the viewer.  Shadow fills the upper right corner of the design, extending down the right edge.  Shadow also fills the space beneath the foremost angel's gown.  A few odd forms upper right, only sketched in outline, hint at serpents.  There may be a chair sketched in outline just right of Enoch."

                "#text": "The subject of this painting is not biblical but might derive from two passages in the Apocrypha, I Timothy 2:5-6 and 1 John 2:1. Jesus stands in the middle of this design, facing forward, but looking slightly to the right. He wears a gown, with a belt at the chest, and has long, curly hair and a beard. An aura of light around his head suggests a halo. He bends his right knee and raises both arms horizontally, with his right palm down and his left palm up. This posture recalls his crucifixion. He is looking at God the Father to his right. To the right of Jesus sits God the Father in his role as a judge, portrayed as an old man with long hair and a beard. He wears a gown and sits, facing left, and presumably looking at Jesus. His left arm is bent and rests on the arm of the chair or throne in which he sits. His right arm is raised at 45 degrees and he holds in his right hand a scepter with a fleur-de-lis finial. His left foot is visible from beneath the hem of his gown. Only the left arm of the throne or chair in which God sits is visible. An angel kneels below God the Father, facing left and hunched over so that he looks down. He wears a gown and has wings and long, slightly curly hair. His arms are bent and his hands are held together as if in prayer or supplication. To the left of Jesus stands Mary Magdalene, facing right and forward. She bends forward into a bow. She wears a gown and has long, curly hair. Her right leg is bent and her right foot is on tiptoe, suggesting that she is walking to the right or about to kneel. Her arms are raised, with her hands folded together on her chest\u2014a gesture that suggests supplication. Surrounding Mary Magdalene are six child-like angels or cherubs, two to the left, one above her, and three to the right. The leftmost angel is seen from behind, though he twists his head to face left. He wears a gown and has wings and long, curly hair. His right leg is extended backward. The middle angel to the left of Mary Magdalene faces right and hovers in mid-air. He wears a gown and has wings. His right arm is bent upward. He may cover his face with his hands or arms, since it is not visible. He may be praying. The angel above Mary Magdalene faces right and down, as though bowing. He wears a gown and has wings and long, curly hair. His arms are bent upward and his mouth may be slightly open. He also floats or hovers in mid-air. The lower angel to the right of Mary Magdalene may hover or stand. This angel appears to be a female child. She faces forward, with her arms raised and her hands together as if in prayer or supplication. She appears to look up at Mary Magdalene. She wears a gown and has wings as well as long hair. The middle angel to the right of Mary Magdalene faces away, though he(?) looks up at Mary Magdalene. His mouth may be open and thus he may be speaking. The wings and long hair of this angel are visible. The upper angel to the right of Mary Magdalene faces forward and may look at Mary Magdalene. Its mouth may be slightly open. This angel's curly hair is visible, but little else besides its head and upper body. This scene takes place in heaven, but the background is dark with the exception of Jesus's aura. Flames wrap from God the Father's feet to the left and above his head along the top margin of the design, and extend to the end of Jesus's right hand."

The exceptions are an Albrecht Durer monogram (\"A\" over \"D\"\u2014see lines 3-4), perhaps inscribed as a model or precedent for the WB signatures, and the numerical calculations in lines 9-11 and 30-31.  Butlin 557.I states that all the inscriptions were \"probably done by the Linnell family.\"  Their motivation for such an activity is unclear; one could understand their placing a single Blake signature on the cover to indicate the authorship of the drawings that follow, but why would anyone other than Blake practice a Blake signature over 30 times on the cover of a valuable sketchbook?  There is at least a slight chance that these inscriptions are by Blake.  The inscriptions on this recto of the outer front cover might have been written along with the similar inscriptions on the conjugate verso of the outer back cover (object 32) before the sheet was folded."

A ram grazes far right, below the \n(stony?) seat or chair on which Job (and his wife?) sit.  A tree, \nperhaps an oak, rises along the right margin and extends its branches \nand leaves along the top margin of the design.  Two stone pillars form \nthe background for Job and his wife; to the left are two grazing sheep \nand, in the background, a clump of trees.  The sky above and to the left \nis cloudy and stormy, an echo of the emotional condition.  Another \nmessenger, perhaps nude but wearing a hat and holding a staff, strides \nenergetically to the left in the middle background; another messenger \nruns on the hill in the distant background.  Trees and a Gothic \nbuilding, perhaps a church, are pictured in the middle distance on the \nfar left.  The foreground, raised into a mound, appears to be covered \nwith grass and perhaps a few flowers below Job and his \nwife."

Her left hand holds his right upper arm.  \nJob holds a rectangular object, probably half a loaf of bread, in his \nright hand.  With his left hand he gives a similar half-loaf to an old \nman with a crutch and a dog on a leash.  Behind the recipient of Job's \ncharity is a winged angel.  Another winged angel hovers on the left.  \nThe near foreground features grass and the leaves of small plants; in \nthe middle distance on the left is a Druid trilithon; the horizon is \ndefined by distant mountains with clouds above.  The upper portion of \nthe central design portrays several dramatic figures, particularly \nSatan.  He is nude, with a slight suggestions of scales over his \ngenitals, descending dramatically to the left.  He hold a vial in his \nright hand from which flames (?), perhaps indicative of pestilence, \ndescend on Job.  Flames rise from this vessel and extend upward right \nand left, with clouds on their outer margins.  On the left are six \nhovering figures, probably angels although without wings.  Their six \nsymmetrical companions on the right are similarly arranged in the \nascending flames.  In the center of this oval composition, God sits on a \nstone throne, raised on a plinth.  He leans to the left and holds a book \nin his right hand, a scroll in his left.  A large and radiant halo \nsurrounds his head and upper body."

A \ntriumphant Satan stands above Job, his feet resting on Job's right thigh \nand abdomen.  Satan is nude, but we can clearly see scales on his hips, \nupper legs, and over his genital area.  His arms are raised \nhorizontally; four arrows descend from just behind his right hand.  He \nholds a vial in his left hand from which spills either a liquid or \nflames.  A (mock?) halo surrounds his head.  The background is dominated \nby billowing clouds (of smoke?) and a sun that is rising or (more \nprobably) setting over the ocean on the far left.  Ruined walls or \nbuildings, a broken cromlech or portal, and broken columns appear in the \nfolds of the hills in the middle distance and background.

Eliphaz the Temanite is the figure leading the \ngroup; his identity is made clear in object 11 (plate numbered 9).  If \nthe friends enter in the same order as they are introduced in Job 2:11, \nthen the next figure to the left is Bildad the Shuhite and farthest to \nthe left is Zophar the Naamathite.

On the right, also \nkneeling and hunched over with faces obscured, are Job's three friends.  \nIf our identifications in object 9 (the plate numbered 7) are correct, then \nthese are (from left to right) Eliphaz (or possibly Zophar), Bildad, and \nZophar (or possibly Eliphaz).  All are gowned.  A few spikes of grass, a \nthorny branch, and perhaps some stones (lower right) adorn the \nforeground.  An archway, with heavy post and lintel, stands in the \nmiddle distance on the right.  A low hill, possibly covered with \nvegetation, extends through the entire middle distance.

Job, again on his bed of \nstraw, looks upward to the vision of God, standing, with a halo and \nbeams of light around him.  Eliphaz, in his vision above, is in bed, his \nhand gesture and hair standing on end indicating his fear of God.  The \nvision in the sky is surrounded by dark cloud bands.  Below, in a \nlandscape defined by a dark sky and mountains on the horizon, we also \nfind Job's wife, seated on the far left and with her face turned upward.  \nA few blades of grass and perhaps small plants adorn the foreground just \nabove the lower border of the central design."

He is \nnude above the waist; a piece of rough (burlap?) cloth covers his loins \nand legs.  His hands are down by his thighs, palms out.  The rough \ntexture of his flesh, particularly visible on his lower arms, suggests \nthe boils that plague him.  His eyes appear to be turned slightly \nupward, as though he is beseeching his God.  His posture, visage, and \ngestures suggest pain and despair.  Job's wife sits far left, her head \ntwisted toward her husband.  Her hair is long; her face now looks a good \ndeal older than in earlier scenes.  Two tears drop from her right eye.  \nBoth feet extend from under the hem of her gown.  Her knees are drawn up \nsharply toward her chest, with both arms wrapped around them.  Her hands \nare open, fingers spread, in a gesture that suggests she is questioning \nJob and his fate.  Job's three friends (probably Eliphaz, Bildad, and \nZophar, front to back) sit, squat, or stand on the right.  They are \ngowned and point accusatory arms, hands, and fingers at Job.  The middle \ndistance is filled with a low hill, perhaps covered with vegetation.  A \nsmall, flowering (?) plant grows on the hill just below the outstretched \nleft hand of the front-most friend/accuser.  A bit of vegetation, \nprobably grass, adorns the foreground just above the lower margin of the \ncentral design.  A large pillar, or section of a wall, anchors the left \nmargin; much smaller structures, perhaps broken columns and ruined \nwalls, appear near the right margin in the middle distance.  The horizon \nis defined by dark mountains; above, the sky is stormy, with dark \nclouds.  The unengraved area in the sky, upper left just above the \nmountains, suggests a feeble light, perhaps from a rising (but more \nprobably setting) sun."
