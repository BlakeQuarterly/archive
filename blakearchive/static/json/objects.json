        "notes": "Bentley designates these as pages 1-16, A, P. Not included here,\n                  among the 18 objects, are the blank verso of object 17 (Bentley page B) and the\n                  blank recto of object 18 (Bentley page O). We are also not including Bentley pages\n                  C-N, all blanks, which are now housed separately from the leaves bearing the\n                  manuscript. Each leaf was originally half of a folio (2 conjugate leaves). Two\n                  or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time prior to 1905, between\n                  leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). The verso of leaf 9 (page B in\n                  Bentley) and the recto of what is now leaf 10 (formerly leaf 16, page O in\n                  Bentley) are blank. These blank pages are not reproduced here. Before rebinding in\n                  1978, there were 6 blank leaves (Bentley pages C-N) of the same paper that bears\n                  the manuscript between what are now leaves 9 and 10 (objects 17-18 as numbered\n                  here). As the sequence of watermarks and countermarks indicates, these blank\n                  leaves were once conjugate with the manuscript. The verso of the final leaf\n                  (object 18 as numbered here and page P in Bentley) bears assorted drawings and\n                  inscriptions. It is included in Butlin's catalogue (no. 149) as \"The Lamb Lying\n                  Down with the Lion and Other Drawings, from 'An Island in the Moon' Manuscript.\"\n                      The watermark appears on leaves 2-8, 10 (objects 3-16, 18 as numbered\n                  here). A countermark, consisting of the letters \"G R\" under a crown, appears on\n                  leaves 1 and 9 (objects 1-2, 17 as numbered here). Object 3 is numbered both 1 and 2 upper left and 5 upper right;\n                  object 5 is numbered 3 upper left and 6 upper right. Objects 7, 11, 13, and 15 are\n                  numbered 9, 6, 7, and 8 upper left. All these numbers are in pencil. They are\n                  probably not written by Blake and thus are not included in our\n                  transcriptions. Each manuscript leaf is mounted\n                  in a paper frame. The present binding was created in 1978; formerly bound in red\n                  morocco with each leaf attached to a stub. The former binding included a\n                  proofsheet of Blake's woodcuts for Robert John Thornton's Pastorals\n                     of Virgil (1821) and a note from A.H. Palmer referring to their\n                  provenance.  Early history not known. Acquired before 1893 by Charles Fairfax Murray; given by\n               Murray to the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1905. A Fitzwilliam Museum collection stamp\n               appears on the verso of the final leaf (object 18 here). Erdman reads the deletion as \"tipsy\" (page 449), Bentley as illegible\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 875), and Phillips as \"tipsy\n                     &\" (page 28). Blake may have first written \"endeavourd\" or \"endeavoured\" before altering\n                     the word to \"endeavouring\". Erdman (page 449) and Phillips (page 28) read \"imagination\" as\n                     \"imaginations\".  Various attempts have been made to\n                     decipher the illegible deletions in lines 24-25. The deletion in line 24\n                     appears to have been an inserted addition following \"Philosophers\" in line 25.\n                     Bentley reads the deletion as \"Quid\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876); Phillips as \"the older\" (page 28); Erdman as \"Quid\" (deleted), replaced\n                     by \"the Older\", mended to \"the Elder\", deleted in turn (pages 450,\n                     849n). \"Inffammable\": i.e., \"Inflammable\" (corrected by Blake,\n                     according to Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 876). In line 32,\n                     the letters \"ee\" in \"see\" appear to have been struck through. A word in line 35, presumably intended for \"Antiquarian\", is\n                     partly covered by an ink spot. A word in line 36, presumably intended for\n                     \"along\", is partly covered by an ink spot. Phillips (page 28) and Erdman (page 450) read\n                     \"outr\u00c3\u00a9\", Bentley \"outr\u00c3\u00a8\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876).  In line 2, the deleted words are probably\n                     \"here the\" (Phillips page 31) preceded by a partially deleted em-dash, but\n                     Bentley reads the deletions as \"----- had the\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 876), Erdman as \"here Etr\" (page 450). In line 4, part of the the \"I\" in \"Inflammable\" has been cut\n                     away. Erdman emends \"staring\" to\n                     \"star[t]ing\" (page 450). \"Obuse\":\n                     i.e., presumably, \"Obtuse\". Erdman (mistakenly) reads an inserted \"said\" just after the deletion\n                     (page 450). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878) and Phillips (page\n                     32) read the deletion as \"and\"; Erdman (page 451) reads it as \"Miss\". Our\n                     reading of \"and\" is uncertain. Phillips reads \"Ma\" instead of \"M.rs\n                     Sigtagatist\" (32). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" instead of \"Sigtagatist\"\n                     throughout (Writings volume 2), but, as Erdman indicates,\n                     \"The name 'Sigtagatist' was first written 'Sistagatist' in most places, but\n                     mended\" (page 849n). In lines 3-7, it is possible that the women's names\n                     replace the deleted men's names, but this substitution is uncertain. Deleted at the end of the line is a phrase, \"All the three Philosophers\",\n                     followed by words that Bentley finds illegible (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878), Phillips reads as \"& very\" (page 32), and Erdman as\n                     \"and the three Philosophers com[in]g\" (page 849n). Our reading of these words\n                     (\"& very\") is uncertain.  In the deletion, Erdman reads \"& Suction\" (page 849n). In the deletion, Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878)\n                     and Erdman (page 849n) omit the \"&\". \"Gibble Gabble the wife of Inflammable\n                     Gass __\" may be part of a larger replacement of women's names for the deleted\n                     men's names in lines 4-6. In the deletion, Phillips omits the \"&\" after \"room\"\n                     (page 32). \"Little Scopprell ... the room\" may be part of a larger replacement\n                     of women's names for the deleted men's names in lines 4-6. \"*Arse\" apparently replaced the deleted\n                     \"Ass\" before both words were deleted and replaced by \"ass_\" (added in light\n                     ink). Erdman, on the basis of the asterisk, restores \"Arse\", to read the line\n                     as \"call me *Arse--)\" (pages 451, 849n). The deletion \"an\" is not noted by Bentley and Erdman. Bentley reads \"would\" as \"wants\" (Writings volume\n                     2, page 878). Bentley reads \"laught\" as \"laughd\" (Writings volume 2, page 878). Bentley reads the\n                     deleted word as \"Comparative(?)\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878). For \"answerd\" (line 31), Erdman reads\n                     \"?exclaimed\" (page 849n). Phillips reads the illegible deletion as \"Miss\"\n                     (page 32); Erdman describes it as a \"short illegible word ending in 'f'\" (page\n                     849n). Phillips reads the deleted phrase (in lines 39-40) as \"of / what you\n                     read\" (page 32), while Erdman reads \"of / what you st\" (page 452). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page 879) throughout. Blake has inserted a\n                     curly bracket that spans lines 10-11. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 880) throughout. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     880) throughout. Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and\n                     Erdman (page 453) read \"Mathematician\". \"why / I know that\" (spanning lines 16, 18) is deleted and then restored (in\n                     line 17) above the deletion and the underscore in line 18. Erdman reads the\n                     deletion as \"?obj Obtuse ?Angle\" (page 849n). The word \"whether\" may be \"whither\". Bentley reads the deletion (lines 31-32) as \"what is this gim(?) used for\" (Writings volume 2, page 849n). For\n                     \"Arsdology\" Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and Erdman\n                     (page 453) read \"Aridology\". Bentley reads \"Hagamy Hatomy\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 881). Erdman reads the deletion as \"Cha\" (page 451) and\n                     Phillips as \"the\" (page 36). Phillips reads the deletion as\n                     \"tw--\" (page 39) and Erdman as \"twen[ty]\" (page 454). Phillips reads the deletion as \"a-\" (page 39). There is a redundant stroke in the first \"p\" of\n                     \"Sipsop\". The deletion (\"bl\") is not noted by Bentley and\n                     Erdman. The heavily deleted words at the end of the line are illegible except for\n                     \"This is\" at the beginning and a lowercase \"f\" midway. Bentley ventures to\n                     decipher \"This is\" (Writings volume 2, page 885); Erdman,\n                     more aggressively, ventures \"This is unfair and ?I ?think\" (page 456). The ink used to delete this line is lighter than the original ink. The illegible deletion is not noted by Erdman. The last word of the line is\n                     \"as\", though Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 885) and Erdman\n                     (page 456) read \"a\" without comment. \"Sopprell\": i.e., presumably, a slip for\n                     \"Scopprell\". \"Gent\" is written over an obscured word\n                     ending in \"man\", deleted by wash. Erdman (page 848) and Phillips (page 43) read\n                     the deleted word at the end of the line as \"Gentleman\". The word \"about\" (an uncertain reading)\n                     is written over text that cannot be recovered. Bentley makes out \"three words del\" (Writings volume 2, page 886),\n                     while Erdman reads \"its a book about\" (page 456). Phillips renders the phrase\n                     as we do here, though he speculates further that the \"first reading may have\n                     been 'Steelyard then' written in light brown ink, evidently the same ink used\n                     to write the first reading 'Gentleman' immediately above. 'Steelyard then' was\n                     then deleted with a full nib in a series of flourishes ending in 'about'\" (page\n                     83n). With this line, Blake shifts to using a lighter\n                     ink. Bentley\n                     reads \"coach\" (Writings volume 2, page 886) instead of\n                     \"coaches\". Phillips reads the final word as \"ride\" but indicates that this reading is\n                     \"conjectured\" (pages 44, 84). Erdman and Bentley see only a three-word\n                     deletion: \"he does not\". Erdman omits the initial ampersand altogether (page\n                     457). Bentley leaves it standing, undeleted (Writings volume\n                     2, page 887). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 887) and Erdman (page 457) both read the last\n                     word of the deletion as \"Envying\". \"kins\" in \"lambkins\" is written over \"s\n                     do\" in \"lambs do\". Bentley reads \"that\" for \"That\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     888). For \"pritty\" Bentley reads \"pretty\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 889). In lines 29 and 31, \"about London / O no\" is legible but deleted \"by\n                     washing out\" (Phillips page 88n). Phillips reads this line\n                     as \"My\", \"written in very pale brown ink\", above \"Nannicantipot\" (pages 47,\n                     88n). But it seems rather to be \"tty\", mirroring the letters just above, in\n                     \"pritty\", and partly erased. In line 31, \"about Matches\" could be replacing the\n                     deleted \"O no\" in the same line and/or the deleted \"about London\" in line\n                     29. \"When\" is washed out but clearly legible above \"Then\", which replaces\n                     it. Erdman reads\n                     the deleted \"sweet\" as \"sweeter\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"?one\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"ll\" (page\n                     459); Bentley does not note the deletion. An erased \"f\", clearly visible before\n                     \"cock\", is the most visible remains of what may be \"This frog\", which was\n                     erased and overwritten with \"Sing co\" in \"Sing cock\" (Erdman page 849n,\n                     Phillips page 90n). The descender of a corrected \"p\" remains\n                     in the middle of \"Sipsop\". Bentley reads \"Sung\" for \"sung\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 891). An illegible\n                     letter or other mark may be deleted between \"Hail\" and \"fingerfooted\". Phillips\n                     reads this as an (undeleted) short dash, \"Hail - fingerfooted\" (page 48).\n                     Bentley and Erdman do not note it. Bentley reads \"widow\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"maidens\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"matrimony\" for \"Matrimony\" and \"how\" for \"How\" (Writings volume 2, page 892).  Erdman reads \"Cynic\" for \"cynic\" (page 460). For \"allways,\" Erdman (page 460) and Phillips (page 51) read\n                     \"always\". The word \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40). In the next line, the letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" are\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41), thus reversing the original order of those\n                     words.  The letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" is\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41). In the previous line, \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40), thus reversing the original order of those\n                  words. The \"s\" at\n                     the end of \"laws\" is made unclear by what may be a spot of ink. Erdman maintains that \"jet\" is \"mended from git\"\n                     (page 850n; also Phillips page 92n). Bentley reads \"give\" for \"gave\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 894). The horizontal line terminates in an area of wash. Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52) read\n                     \"foolish.--\". Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 894) and Erdman (page\n                     462) omit the period after \"louse\". Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52)\n                     read the deleted word at the end of the line, which begins with a legible \"cl\"\n                     and has been both struck through and erased, as \"climing\" (that is,\n                     climbing). Phillips reads a period\n                     after the comma (page 52). Bentley reads \"slides\"\n                     instead of \"sliders\" (Writings volume 2, page 894). Erdman reads a period after the dash (page 462). Erdman reads the deleted \"he\" after \"room.\", less probably, as \"Go\" (page\n                     462). Bentley reads the deletions that begin at the end of line 1 as \"you are\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 895), Erdman as \"you / ar\" (page\n                     462), Phillips as \"gas / --\" (page 55). Beyond the descender on the first word,\n                     the deletions are illegible and the readings speculative. This is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched with\n                     designs, became \"Holy Thursday\" in Songs of Innocence, 1789\n                     (Bentley plate 19). For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 18-20. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     93-94n). This line was probably written in the break between the original stanzas 2\n                     and 3 as a replacement for the final line of stanza 2 (line 21) after Blake had\n                     deleted it. A four-line stanza (lines 23-26) has been\n                     deleted. After it was deleted, the second couplet (lines 25-26) was not reused;\n                     the first couplet (lines 23-24) was rewritten and used to introduce the revised\n                     stanza below (lines 27-30). This unrhymed line is unique in a poem otherwise\n                     written in couplets. Erdman reads \"Cherubim & Seraphim\" (page 850n). Lines 28-31 make up the revised stanza that\n                     replaces the deleted four-line stanza (lines 23-26) and the unrhymed verse that\n                     follows (line 27). A second lowercase \"g\" is written over the original \"g\" in \"among\", perhaps\n                     to strengthen it.  Bentley reads the deletion as \"Mrs Sistagatist\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 896). Bentley reads the deletion as \"Grand\" (Writings volume 2, page 896). \"The voice\" is washed out. These lines\n                     (35-44) make up the opening two stanzas of the earliest known draft of the poem\n                     that, etched with designs, became \"Nurse's Song\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 24). The poem continues on the next page\n                     of the manuscript. For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 94-95n. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     94-95n). The spacing and\n                     lettering suggest that the line originally began \"The tongues\". Blake then\n                     inserted \"When\" before \"The\" and altered \"The\" to \"the\" to read \"When the\n                     tongues\". These two stanzas (lines 1-11) complete the draft of \"Nurse's Song\"\n                     that begins on the previous page (14.35-44). Erdman outlines the sequence of revisions thus: Blake originally wrote\n                     \"cannot go to sleep\", emended it to \"cannot sleep till its dark\", and then\n                     restored the original \"cannot go to sleep\" (page 850n). Phillips describes a\n                     similar sequence, but notes that the original \"go to\" was overwritten by \"get\n                     to\" and \"till its dark\" was added to the line (to read \"and we cannot get to\n                     sleep till its dark\"). Phillips claims that Blake then restored the original\n                     \"go to\" by a supralinear insertion and deleted \"till its dark\" (page 95n). See\n                     note for line 4 for additional information about Blake's revisions to these\n                     lines. Phillips gives a plausible account of the revisions in lines 2-4 that hinges\n                     on the notion that Blake, \"momentarily forgetting the rhyme scheme [abcb]\n                     established in the first stanzas on the preceding page\", wrote line 4, made\n                     some adjustments in lines 2-3, and then recognizing \"his mistake ... restored\n                     the original reading\" of line 3, deleted line 4, and then \"went on to write the\n                     next two lines\" in conformity with the original rhyme scheme (page 95n). Erdman reads a lowercase initial \"s\" in the undeleted \"Sung Quid\" at the end\n                     of the line (page 463). This (lines 13-20) is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched\n                     with designs, became \"The Little Boy lost\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 13). Phillips prints a version of the\n                     poem that displays the differences between this and the etched version (page\n                     96). The word \"turd\" is deleted and replaced by \"tansey\", written in\n                     lighter ink. Erdman reads the beginning of the deletion as \"To hit me\" (page\n                     850n). Erdman reads \"a[ny bird the\"\n                     (page 850n); Bentley \"[\u00e2\u0080\u0083 \u00e2\u0080\u0083d he del]\" (Writings volume 2, page 897); Phillips \"an old\n                        he (page 56). Phillips reads \"began-\" (page 56). The phrase \"leave to\" is presumably a slip for\n                     \"leave me to\". \"O\" is written over \"l\" (probably the start of \"leave\",\n                     conjectures Erdman, page 850n). Two lines (15-16) have been deleted, leaving them only partly legible. They\n                     may read (with Erdman page 850n), \"How many Blackamoors / Coud sing with their\n                     thick lips\". Blake may have originally started line 15 with \"If\" before\n                     changing to \"How\" (Erdman page 850n). Bentley reads line 15 less confidently:\n                        \"If(?) we(?) manage(?)\n                     Blackamoors\" (Writings volume 2, page 898). And there is\n                     considerable uncertainty in the reading of the first word of line 16, which may\n                     be \"Will\" (Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 898), \"Coud\"\n                     (Erdman page 850n), or \"cant\" (Phillips page 59). Bentley reads the opening word of the line as \"thus\" (Writings volume 2, page 899). Phillips reads the deleted word(s) following \"other\" as \"sheet a\" (page 60).\n                     Bentley notes only \"word del\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 899), while Erdman does not note the deletion. Bentley reads \"Sicknackers\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899), Phillips \"Sicknakers\" (page 60). Between \"people\" and \"who\" is a stroke \u00e2\u0080\u0094 probably a false start\n                     \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that Phillips reads as a short dash (page 60). \"abilies\": i.e., presumably, a slip for \"abilities\".\n                     Bentley reads \"abilies\" as \"abities\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899).  \"yo\": i.e.,\n                     presumably, a slip for \"you\". The illegible letters and \"William Blake\" have been\n                  smudged. All of the text in this line has\n                     been smudged. The \"N\" has been\n                     smudged. The gap indicates a partial letter. It may be the backstroke for a capital\n                     letter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 perhaps \"B\". At the beginning of the line\n                     are two partial letters. The first may be a partial capital \"T\" or \"F\". The\n                     second is a small partial stroke. The second legible \"n\" has been\n                     smudged. The text has been smudged. The \"m\" has been smudged. The words \"William Blake\" appear to\n                     have been cancelled.  \"Lamb\", written in a very small hand, is\n                     almost obscured by the first large \"n\". The second \"n\" has been lightly\n                     smudged. The illegible text at the end of the line appears to be a partial\n                     letter\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps \"c\" or \"o\". The illegible text could be the capital letter \"L\" or simply a\n                     squiggle. The letters \"Bl\" (followed by an uncertain letter \"a\") are written in\n                     backwards lettering. They are also smudged. The\n                     text has been smudged, and is written vertically in the lower right quadrant of\n                     the page. The blank verso of this leaf, designated as page B in Bentley and showing a\n                  considerable amount of show-through of the writing on this recto, is not\n                  reproduced here. Two or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time\n                  prior to 1905, between leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). Refer to\n                  the Work Information for more details about the manuscript. A diagonal pencil\n                  inscription at the bottom of the page, not in Blake's hand, reads, \"a leaf is\n                  evidently missing before this one\". At least some of the sketches and lettering on the verso (reproduced here) may\n                  conceivably be the product of both William Blake and his youngest brother Robert\n                  (1762-87). The awkwardness and redundancy of some of the work, the bare geometry\n                  of the head of the large lion(?) in the lower pair of animals in the upper left\n                  quadrant of the page, and the heavy overdrawing on some of the other animals are\n                  among the features that may possibly reflect Robert's attempts to draw subjects\n                  that had been set as exercises for him by older brother William, and, in some\n                  instances, corrected by one of them.The blank recto, designated as page O in Bentley, and showing a considerable\n                  amount of show-through from the ink lines on this verso, is not reproduced\n                  here.",

        "notes": "Bentley designates these as pages 1-16, A, P. Not included here,\n                  among the 18 objects, are the blank verso of object 17 (Bentley page B) and the\n                  blank recto of object 18 (Bentley page O). We are also not including Bentley pages\n                  C-N, all blanks, which are now housed separately from the leaves bearing the\n                  manuscript. Each leaf was originally half of a folio (2 conjugate leaves). Two\n                  or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time prior to 1905, between\n                  leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). The verso of leaf 9 (page B in\n                  Bentley) and the recto of what is now leaf 10 (formerly leaf 16, page O in\n                  Bentley) are blank. These blank pages are not reproduced here. Before rebinding in\n                  1978, there were 6 blank leaves (Bentley pages C-N) of the same paper that bears\n                  the manuscript between what are now leaves 9 and 10 (objects 17-18 as numbered\n                  here). As the sequence of watermarks and countermarks indicates, these blank\n                  leaves were once conjugate with the manuscript. The verso of the final leaf\n                  (object 18 as numbered here and page P in Bentley) bears assorted drawings and\n                  inscriptions. It is included in Butlin's catalogue (no. 149) as \"The Lamb Lying\n                  Down with the Lion and Other Drawings, from 'An Island in the Moon' Manuscript.\"\n                      The watermark appears on leaves 2-8, 10 (objects 3-16, 18 as numbered\n                  here). A countermark, consisting of the letters \"G R\" under a crown, appears on\n                  leaves 1 and 9 (objects 1-2, 17 as numbered here). Object 3 is numbered both 1 and 2 upper left and 5 upper right;\n                  object 5 is numbered 3 upper left and 6 upper right. Objects 7, 11, 13, and 15 are\n                  numbered 9, 6, 7, and 8 upper left. All these numbers are in pencil. They are\n                  probably not written by Blake and thus are not included in our\n                  transcriptions. Each manuscript leaf is mounted\n                  in a paper frame. The present binding was created in 1978; formerly bound in red\n                  morocco with each leaf attached to a stub. The former binding included a\n                  proofsheet of Blake's woodcuts for Robert John Thornton's Pastorals\n                     of Virgil (1821) and a note from A.H. Palmer referring to their\n                  provenance.  Early history not known. Acquired before 1893 by Charles Fairfax Murray; given by\n               Murray to the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1905. A Fitzwilliam Museum collection stamp\n               appears on the verso of the final leaf (object 18 here). Erdman reads the deletion as \"tipsy\" (page 449), Bentley as illegible\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 875), and Phillips as \"tipsy\n                     &\" (page 28). Blake may have first written \"endeavourd\" or \"endeavoured\" before altering\n                     the word to \"endeavouring\". Erdman (page 449) and Phillips (page 28) read \"imagination\" as\n                     \"imaginations\".  Various attempts have been made to\n                     decipher the illegible deletions in lines 24-25. The deletion in line 24\n                     appears to have been an inserted addition following \"Philosophers\" in line 25.\n                     Bentley reads the deletion as \"Quid\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876); Phillips as \"the older\" (page 28); Erdman as \"Quid\" (deleted), replaced\n                     by \"the Older\", mended to \"the Elder\", deleted in turn (pages 450,\n                     849n). \"Inffammable\": i.e., \"Inflammable\" (corrected by Blake,\n                     according to Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 876). In line 32,\n                     the letters \"ee\" in \"see\" appear to have been struck through. A word in line 35, presumably intended for \"Antiquarian\", is\n                     partly covered by an ink spot. A word in line 36, presumably intended for\n                     \"along\", is partly covered by an ink spot. Phillips (page 28) and Erdman (page 450) read\n                     \"outr\u00c3\u00a9\", Bentley \"outr\u00c3\u00a8\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876).  In line 2, the deleted words are probably\n                     \"here the\" (Phillips page 31) preceded by a partially deleted em-dash, but\n                     Bentley reads the deletions as \"----- had the\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 876), Erdman as \"here Etr\" (page 450). In line 4, part of the the \"I\" in \"Inflammable\" has been cut\n                     away. Erdman emends \"staring\" to\n                     \"star[t]ing\" (page 450). \"Obuse\":\n                     i.e., presumably, \"Obtuse\". Erdman (mistakenly) reads an inserted \"said\" just after the deletion\n                     (page 450). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878) and Phillips (page\n                     32) read the deletion as \"and\"; Erdman (page 451) reads it as \"Miss\". Our\n                     reading of \"and\" is uncertain. Phillips reads \"Ma\" instead of \"M.rs\n                     Sigtagatist\" (32). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" instead of \"Sigtagatist\"\n                     throughout (Writings volume 2), but, as Erdman indicates,\n                     \"The name 'Sigtagatist' was first written 'Sistagatist' in most places, but\n                     mended\" (page 849n). In lines 3-7, it is possible that the women's names\n                     replace the deleted men's names, but this substitution is uncertain. Deleted at the end of the line is a phrase, \"All the three Philosophers\",\n                     followed by words that Bentley finds illegible (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878), Phillips reads as \"& very\" (page 32), and Erdman as\n                     \"and the three Philosophers com[in]g\" (page 849n). Our reading of these words\n                     (\"& very\") is uncertain.  In the deletion, Erdman reads \"& Suction\" (page 849n). In the deletion, Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878)\n                     and Erdman (page 849n) omit the \"&\". \"Gibble Gabble the wife of Inflammable\n                     Gass __\" may be part of a larger replacement of women's names for the deleted\n                     men's names in lines 4-6. In the deletion, Phillips omits the \"&\" after \"room\"\n                     (page 32). \"Little Scopprell ... the room\" may be part of a larger replacement\n                     of women's names for the deleted men's names in lines 4-6. \"*Arse\" apparently replaced the deleted\n                     \"Ass\" before both words were deleted and replaced by \"ass_\" (added in light\n                     ink). Erdman, on the basis of the asterisk, restores \"Arse\", to read the line\n                     as \"call me *Arse--)\" (pages 451, 849n). The deletion \"an\" is not noted by Bentley and Erdman. Bentley reads \"would\" as \"wants\" (Writings volume\n                     2, page 878). Bentley reads \"laught\" as \"laughd\" (Writings volume 2, page 878). Bentley reads the\n                     deleted word as \"Comparative(?)\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878). For \"answerd\" (line 31), Erdman reads\n                     \"?exclaimed\" (page 849n). Phillips reads the illegible deletion as \"Miss\"\n                     (page 32); Erdman describes it as a \"short illegible word ending in 'f'\" (page\n                     849n). Phillips reads the deleted phrase (in lines 39-40) as \"of / what you\n                     read\" (page 32), while Erdman reads \"of / what you st\" (page 452). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page 879) throughout. Blake has inserted a\n                     curly bracket that spans lines 10-11. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 880) throughout. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     880) throughout. Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and\n                     Erdman (page 453) read \"Mathematician\". \"why / I know that\" (spanning lines 16, 18) is deleted and then restored (in\n                     line 17) above the deletion and the underscore in line 18. Erdman reads the\n                     deletion as \"?obj Obtuse ?Angle\" (page 849n). The word \"whether\" may be \"whither\". Bentley reads the deletion (lines 31-32) as \"what is this gim(?) used for\" (Writings volume 2, page 849n). For\n                     \"Arsdology\" Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and Erdman\n                     (page 453) read \"Aridology\". Bentley reads \"Hagamy Hatomy\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 881). Erdman reads the deletion as \"Cha\" (page 451) and\n                     Phillips as \"the\" (page 36). Phillips reads the deletion as\n                     \"tw--\" (page 39) and Erdman as \"twen[ty]\" (page 454). Phillips reads the deletion as \"a-\" (page 39). There is a redundant stroke in the first \"p\" of\n                     \"Sipsop\". The deletion (\"bl\") is not noted by Bentley and\n                     Erdman. The heavily deleted words at the end of the line are illegible except for\n                     \"This is\" at the beginning and a lowercase \"f\" midway. Bentley ventures to\n                     decipher \"This is\" (Writings volume 2, page 885); Erdman,\n                     more aggressively, ventures \"This is unfair and ?I ?think\" (page 456). The ink used to delete this line is lighter than the original ink. The illegible deletion is not noted by Erdman. The last word of the line is\n                     \"as\", though Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 885) and Erdman\n                     (page 456) read \"a\" without comment. \"Sopprell\": i.e., presumably, a slip for\n                     \"Scopprell\". \"Gent\" is written over an obscured word\n                     ending in \"man\", deleted by wash. Erdman (page 848) and Phillips (page 43) read\n                     the deleted word at the end of the line as \"Gentleman\". The word \"about\" (an uncertain reading)\n                     is written over text that cannot be recovered. Bentley makes out \"three words del\" (Writings volume 2, page 886),\n                     while Erdman reads \"its a book about\" (page 456). Phillips renders the phrase\n                     as we do here, though he speculates further that the \"first reading may have\n                     been 'Steelyard then' written in light brown ink, evidently the same ink used\n                     to write the first reading 'Gentleman' immediately above. 'Steelyard then' was\n                     then deleted with a full nib in a series of flourishes ending in 'about'\" (page\n                     83n). With this line, Blake shifts to using a lighter\n                     ink. Bentley\n                     reads \"coach\" (Writings volume 2, page 886) instead of\n                     \"coaches\". Phillips reads the final word as \"ride\" but indicates that this reading is\n                     \"conjectured\" (pages 44, 84). Erdman and Bentley see only a three-word\n                     deletion: \"he does not\". Erdman omits the initial ampersand altogether (page\n                     457). Bentley leaves it standing, undeleted (Writings volume\n                     2, page 887). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 887) and Erdman (page 457) both read the last\n                     word of the deletion as \"Envying\". \"kins\" in \"lambkins\" is written over \"s\n                     do\" in \"lambs do\". Bentley reads \"that\" for \"That\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     888). For \"pritty\" Bentley reads \"pretty\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 889). In lines 29 and 31, \"about London / O no\" is legible but deleted \"by\n                     washing out\" (Phillips page 88n). Phillips reads this line\n                     as \"My\", \"written in very pale brown ink\", above \"Nannicantipot\" (pages 47,\n                     88n). But it seems rather to be \"tty\", mirroring the letters just above, in\n                     \"pritty\", and partly erased. In line 31, \"about Matches\" could be replacing the\n                     deleted \"O no\" in the same line and/or the deleted \"about London\" in line\n                     29. \"When\" is washed out but clearly legible above \"Then\", which replaces\n                     it. Erdman reads\n                     the deleted \"sweet\" as \"sweeter\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"?one\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"ll\" (page\n                     459); Bentley does not note the deletion. An erased \"f\", clearly visible before\n                     \"cock\", is the most visible remains of what may be \"This frog\", which was\n                     erased and overwritten with \"Sing co\" in \"Sing cock\" (Erdman page 849n,\n                     Phillips page 90n). The descender of a corrected \"p\" remains\n                     in the middle of \"Sipsop\". Bentley reads \"Sung\" for \"sung\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 891). An illegible\n                     letter or other mark may be deleted between \"Hail\" and \"fingerfooted\". Phillips\n                     reads this as an (undeleted) short dash, \"Hail - fingerfooted\" (page 48).\n                     Bentley and Erdman do not note it. Bentley reads \"widow\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"maidens\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"matrimony\" for \"Matrimony\" and \"how\" for \"How\" (Writings volume 2, page 892).  Erdman reads \"Cynic\" for \"cynic\" (page 460). For \"allways,\" Erdman (page 460) and Phillips (page 51) read\n                     \"always\". The word \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40). In the next line, the letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" are\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41), thus reversing the original order of those\n                     words.  The letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" is\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41). In the previous line, \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40), thus reversing the original order of those\n                  words. The \"s\" at\n                     the end of \"laws\" is made unclear by what may be a spot of ink. Erdman maintains that \"jet\" is \"mended from git\"\n                     (page 850n; also Phillips page 92n). Bentley reads \"give\" for \"gave\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 894). The horizontal line terminates in an area of wash. Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52) read\n                     \"foolish.--\". Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 894) and Erdman (page\n                     462) omit the period after \"louse\". Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52)\n                     read the deleted word at the end of the line, which begins with a legible \"cl\"\n                     and has been both struck through and erased, as \"climing\" (that is,\n                     climbing). Phillips reads a period\n                     after the comma (page 52). Bentley reads \"slides\"\n                     instead of \"sliders\" (Writings volume 2, page 894). Erdman reads a period after the dash (page 462). Erdman reads the deleted \"he\" after \"room.\", less probably, as \"Go\" (page\n                     462). Bentley reads the deletions that begin at the end of line 1 as \"you are\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 895), Erdman as \"you / ar\" (page\n                     462), Phillips as \"gas / --\" (page 55). Beyond the descender on the first word,\n                     the deletions are illegible and the readings speculative. This is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched with\n                     designs, became \"Holy Thursday\" in Songs of Innocence, 1789\n                     (Bentley plate 19). For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 18-20. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     93-94n). This line was probably written in the break between the original stanzas 2\n                     and 3 as a replacement for the final line of stanza 2 (line 21) after Blake had\n                     deleted it. A four-line stanza (lines 23-26) has been\n                     deleted. After it was deleted, the second couplet (lines 25-26) was not reused;\n                     the first couplet (lines 23-24) was rewritten and used to introduce the revised\n                     stanza below (lines 27-30). This unrhymed line is unique in a poem otherwise\n                     written in couplets. Erdman reads \"Cherubim & Seraphim\" (page 850n). Lines 28-31 make up the revised stanza that\n                     replaces the deleted four-line stanza (lines 23-26) and the unrhymed verse that\n                     follows (line 27). A second lowercase \"g\" is written over the original \"g\" in \"among\", perhaps\n                     to strengthen it.  Bentley reads the deletion as \"Mrs Sistagatist\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 896). Bentley reads the deletion as \"Grand\" (Writings volume 2, page 896). \"The voice\" is washed out. These lines\n                     (35-44) make up the opening two stanzas of the earliest known draft of the poem\n                     that, etched with designs, became \"Nurse's Song\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 24). The poem continues on the next page\n                     of the manuscript. For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 94-95n. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     94-95n). The spacing and\n                     lettering suggest that the line originally began \"The tongues\". Blake then\n                     inserted \"When\" before \"The\" and altered \"The\" to \"the\" to read \"When the\n                     tongues\". These two stanzas (lines 1-11) complete the draft of \"Nurse's Song\"\n                     that begins on the previous page (14.35-44). Erdman outlines the sequence of revisions thus: Blake originally wrote\n                     \"cannot go to sleep\", emended it to \"cannot sleep till its dark\", and then\n                     restored the original \"cannot go to sleep\" (page 850n). Phillips describes a\n                     similar sequence, but notes that the original \"go to\" was overwritten by \"get\n                     to\" and \"till its dark\" was added to the line (to read \"and we cannot get to\n                     sleep till its dark\"). Phillips claims that Blake then restored the original\n                     \"go to\" by a supralinear insertion and deleted \"till its dark\" (page 95n). See\n                     note for line 4 for additional information about Blake's revisions to these\n                     lines. Phillips gives a plausible account of the revisions in lines 2-4 that hinges\n                     on the notion that Blake, \"momentarily forgetting the rhyme scheme [abcb]\n                     established in the first stanzas on the preceding page\", wrote line 4, made\n                     some adjustments in lines 2-3, and then recognizing \"his mistake ... restored\n                     the original reading\" of line 3, deleted line 4, and then \"went on to write the\n                     next two lines\" in conformity with the original rhyme scheme (page 95n). Erdman reads a lowercase initial \"s\" in the undeleted \"Sung Quid\" at the end\n                     of the line (page 463). This (lines 13-20) is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched\n                     with designs, became \"The Little Boy lost\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 13). Phillips prints a version of the\n                     poem that displays the differences between this and the etched version (page\n                     96). The word \"turd\" is deleted and replaced by \"tansey\", written in\n                     lighter ink. Erdman reads the beginning of the deletion as \"To hit me\" (page\n                     850n). Erdman reads \"a[ny bird the\"\n                     (page 850n); Bentley \"[\u00e2\u0080\u0083 \u00e2\u0080\u0083d he del]\" (Writings volume 2, page 897); Phillips \"an old\n                        he (page 56). Phillips reads \"began-\" (page 56). The phrase \"leave to\" is presumably a slip for\n                     \"leave me to\". \"O\" is written over \"l\" (probably the start of \"leave\",\n                     conjectures Erdman, page 850n). Two lines (15-16) have been deleted, leaving them only partly legible. They\n                     may read (with Erdman page 850n), \"How many Blackamoors / Coud sing with their\n                     thick lips\". Blake may have originally started line 15 with \"If\" before\n                     changing to \"How\" (Erdman page 850n). Bentley reads line 15 less confidently:\n                        \"If(?) we(?) manage(?)\n                     Blackamoors\" (Writings volume 2, page 898). And there is\n                     considerable uncertainty in the reading of the first word of line 16, which may\n                     be \"Will\" (Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 898), \"Coud\"\n                     (Erdman page 850n), or \"cant\" (Phillips page 59). Bentley reads the opening word of the line as \"thus\" (Writings volume 2, page 899). Phillips reads the deleted word(s) following \"other\" as \"sheet a\" (page 60).\n                     Bentley notes only \"word del\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 899), while Erdman does not note the deletion. Bentley reads \"Sicknackers\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899), Phillips \"Sicknakers\" (page 60). Between \"people\" and \"who\" is a stroke \u00e2\u0080\u0094 probably a false start\n                     \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that Phillips reads as a short dash (page 60). \"abilies\": i.e., presumably, a slip for \"abilities\".\n                     Bentley reads \"abilies\" as \"abities\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899).  \"yo\": i.e.,\n                     presumably, a slip for \"you\". The illegible letters and \"William Blake\" have been\n                  smudged. All of the text in this line has\n                     been smudged. The \"N\" has been\n                     smudged. The gap indicates a partial letter. It may be the backstroke for a capital\n                     letter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 perhaps \"B\". At the beginning of the line\n                     are two partial letters. The first may be a partial capital \"T\" or \"F\". The\n                     second is a small partial stroke. The second legible \"n\" has been\n                     smudged. The text has been smudged. The \"m\" has been smudged. The words \"William Blake\" appear to\n                     have been cancelled.  \"Lamb\", written in a very small hand, is\n                     almost obscured by the first large \"n\". The second \"n\" has been lightly\n                     smudged. The illegible text at the end of the line appears to be a partial\n                     letter\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps \"c\" or \"o\". The illegible text could be the capital letter \"L\" or simply a\n                     squiggle. The letters \"Bl\" (followed by an uncertain letter \"a\") are written in\n                     backwards lettering. They are also smudged. The\n                     text has been smudged, and is written vertically in the lower right quadrant of\n                     the page. The blank verso of this leaf, designated as page B in Bentley and showing a\n                  considerable amount of show-through of the writing on this recto, is not\n                  reproduced here. Two or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time\n                  prior to 1905, between leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). Refer to\n                  the Work Information for more details about the manuscript. A diagonal pencil\n                  inscription at the bottom of the page, not in Blake's hand, reads, \"a leaf is\n                  evidently missing before this one\". At least some of the sketches and lettering on the verso (reproduced here) may\n                  conceivably be the product of both William Blake and his youngest brother Robert\n                  (1762-87). The awkwardness and redundancy of some of the work, the bare geometry\n                  of the head of the large lion(?) in the lower pair of animals in the upper left\n                  quadrant of the page, and the heavy overdrawing on some of the other animals are\n                  among the features that may possibly reflect Robert's attempts to draw subjects\n                  that had been set as exercises for him by older brother William, and, in some\n                  instances, corrected by one of them.The blank recto, designated as page O in Bentley, and showing a considerable\n                  amount of show-through from the ink lines on this verso, is not reproduced\n                  here.",

        "notes": "Bentley designates these as pages 1-16, A, P. Not included here,\n                  among the 18 objects, are the blank verso of object 17 (Bentley page B) and the\n                  blank recto of object 18 (Bentley page O). We are also not including Bentley pages\n                  C-N, all blanks, which are now housed separately from the leaves bearing the\n                  manuscript. Each leaf was originally half of a folio (2 conjugate leaves). Two\n                  or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time prior to 1905, between\n                  leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). The verso of leaf 9 (page B in\n                  Bentley) and the recto of what is now leaf 10 (formerly leaf 16, page O in\n                  Bentley) are blank. These blank pages are not reproduced here. Before rebinding in\n                  1978, there were 6 blank leaves (Bentley pages C-N) of the same paper that bears\n                  the manuscript between what are now leaves 9 and 10 (objects 17-18 as numbered\n                  here). As the sequence of watermarks and countermarks indicates, these blank\n                  leaves were once conjugate with the manuscript. The verso of the final leaf\n                  (object 18 as numbered here and page P in Bentley) bears assorted drawings and\n                  inscriptions. It is included in Butlin's catalogue (no. 149) as \"The Lamb Lying\n                  Down with the Lion and Other Drawings, from 'An Island in the Moon' Manuscript.\"\n                      The watermark appears on leaves 2-8, 10 (objects 3-16, 18 as numbered\n                  here). A countermark, consisting of the letters \"G R\" under a crown, appears on\n                  leaves 1 and 9 (objects 1-2, 17 as numbered here). Object 3 is numbered both 1 and 2 upper left and 5 upper right;\n                  object 5 is numbered 3 upper left and 6 upper right. Objects 7, 11, 13, and 15 are\n                  numbered 9, 6, 7, and 8 upper left. All these numbers are in pencil. They are\n                  probably not written by Blake and thus are not included in our\n                  transcriptions. Each manuscript leaf is mounted\n                  in a paper frame. The present binding was created in 1978; formerly bound in red\n                  morocco with each leaf attached to a stub. The former binding included a\n                  proofsheet of Blake's woodcuts for Robert John Thornton's Pastorals\n                     of Virgil (1821) and a note from A.H. Palmer referring to their\n                  provenance.  Early history not known. Acquired before 1893 by Charles Fairfax Murray; given by\n               Murray to the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1905. A Fitzwilliam Museum collection stamp\n               appears on the verso of the final leaf (object 18 here). Erdman reads the deletion as \"tipsy\" (page 449), Bentley as illegible\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 875), and Phillips as \"tipsy\n                     &\" (page 28). Blake may have first written \"endeavourd\" or \"endeavoured\" before altering\n                     the word to \"endeavouring\". Erdman (page 449) and Phillips (page 28) read \"imagination\" as\n                     \"imaginations\".  Various attempts have been made to\n                     decipher the illegible deletions in lines 24-25. The deletion in line 24\n                     appears to have been an inserted addition following \"Philosophers\" in line 25.\n                     Bentley reads the deletion as \"Quid\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876); Phillips as \"the older\" (page 28); Erdman as \"Quid\" (deleted), replaced\n                     by \"the Older\", mended to \"the Elder\", deleted in turn (pages 450,\n                     849n). \"Inffammable\": i.e., \"Inflammable\" (corrected by Blake,\n                     according to Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 876). In line 32,\n                     the letters \"ee\" in \"see\" appear to have been struck through. A word in line 35, presumably intended for \"Antiquarian\", is\n                     partly covered by an ink spot. A word in line 36, presumably intended for\n                     \"along\", is partly covered by an ink spot. Phillips (page 28) and Erdman (page 450) read\n                     \"outr\u00c3\u00a9\", Bentley \"outr\u00c3\u00a8\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876).  In line 2, the deleted words are probably\n                     \"here the\" (Phillips page 31) preceded by a partially deleted em-dash, but\n                     Bentley reads the deletions as \"----- had the\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 876), Erdman as \"here Etr\" (page 450). In line 4, part of the the \"I\" in \"Inflammable\" has been cut\n                     away. Erdman emends \"staring\" to\n                     \"star[t]ing\" (page 450). \"Obuse\":\n                     i.e., presumably, \"Obtuse\". Erdman (mistakenly) reads an inserted \"said\" just after the deletion\n                     (page 450). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878) and Phillips (page\n                     32) read the deletion as \"and\"; Erdman (page 451) reads it as \"Miss\". Our\n                     reading of \"and\" is uncertain. Phillips reads \"Ma\" instead of \"M.rs\n                     Sigtagatist\" (32). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" instead of \"Sigtagatist\"\n                     throughout (Writings volume 2), but, as Erdman indicates,\n                     \"The name 'Sigtagatist' was first written 'Sistagatist' in most places, but\n                     mended\" (page 849n). In lines 3-7, it is possible that the women's names\n                     replace the deleted men's names, but this substitution is uncertain. Deleted at the end of the line is a phrase, \"All the three Philosophers\",\n                     followed by words that Bentley finds illegible (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878), Phillips reads as \"& very\" (page 32), and Erdman as\n                     \"and the three Philosophers com[in]g\" (page 849n). Our reading of these words\n                     (\"& very\") is uncertain.  In the deletion, Erdman reads \"& Suction\" (page 849n). In the deletion, Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878)\n                     and Erdman (page 849n) omit the \"&\". \"Gibble Gabble the wife of Inflammable\n                     Gass __\" may be part of a larger replacement of women's names for the deleted\n                     men's names in lines 4-6. In the deletion, Phillips omits the \"&\" after \"room\"\n                     (page 32). \"Little Scopprell ... the room\" may be part of a larger replacement\n                     of women's names for the deleted men's names in lines 4-6. \"*Arse\" apparently replaced the deleted\n                     \"Ass\" before both words were deleted and replaced by \"ass_\" (added in light\n                     ink). Erdman, on the basis of the asterisk, restores \"Arse\", to read the line\n                     as \"call me *Arse--)\" (pages 451, 849n). The deletion \"an\" is not noted by Bentley and Erdman. Bentley reads \"would\" as \"wants\" (Writings volume\n                     2, page 878). Bentley reads \"laught\" as \"laughd\" (Writings volume 2, page 878). Bentley reads the\n                     deleted word as \"Comparative(?)\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878). For \"answerd\" (line 31), Erdman reads\n                     \"?exclaimed\" (page 849n). Phillips reads the illegible deletion as \"Miss\"\n                     (page 32); Erdman describes it as a \"short illegible word ending in 'f'\" (page\n                     849n). Phillips reads the deleted phrase (in lines 39-40) as \"of / what you\n                     read\" (page 32), while Erdman reads \"of / what you st\" (page 452). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page 879) throughout. Blake has inserted a\n                     curly bracket that spans lines 10-11. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 880) throughout. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     880) throughout. Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and\n                     Erdman (page 453) read \"Mathematician\". \"why / I know that\" (spanning lines 16, 18) is deleted and then restored (in\n                     line 17) above the deletion and the underscore in line 18. Erdman reads the\n                     deletion as \"?obj Obtuse ?Angle\" (page 849n). The word \"whether\" may be \"whither\". Bentley reads the deletion (lines 31-32) as \"what is this gim(?) used for\" (Writings volume 2, page 849n). For\n                     \"Arsdology\" Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and Erdman\n                     (page 453) read \"Aridology\". Bentley reads \"Hagamy Hatomy\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 881). Erdman reads the deletion as \"Cha\" (page 451) and\n                     Phillips as \"the\" (page 36). Phillips reads the deletion as\n                     \"tw--\" (page 39) and Erdman as \"twen[ty]\" (page 454). Phillips reads the deletion as \"a-\" (page 39). There is a redundant stroke in the first \"p\" of\n                     \"Sipsop\". The deletion (\"bl\") is not noted by Bentley and\n                     Erdman. The heavily deleted words at the end of the line are illegible except for\n                     \"This is\" at the beginning and a lowercase \"f\" midway. Bentley ventures to\n                     decipher \"This is\" (Writings volume 2, page 885); Erdman,\n                     more aggressively, ventures \"This is unfair and ?I ?think\" (page 456). The ink used to delete this line is lighter than the original ink. The illegible deletion is not noted by Erdman. The last word of the line is\n                     \"as\", though Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 885) and Erdman\n                     (page 456) read \"a\" without comment. \"Sopprell\": i.e., presumably, a slip for\n                     \"Scopprell\". \"Gent\" is written over an obscured word\n                     ending in \"man\", deleted by wash. Erdman (page 848) and Phillips (page 43) read\n                     the deleted word at the end of the line as \"Gentleman\". The word \"about\" (an uncertain reading)\n                     is written over text that cannot be recovered. Bentley makes out \"three words del\" (Writings volume 2, page 886),\n                     while Erdman reads \"its a book about\" (page 456). Phillips renders the phrase\n                     as we do here, though he speculates further that the \"first reading may have\n                     been 'Steelyard then' written in light brown ink, evidently the same ink used\n                     to write the first reading 'Gentleman' immediately above. 'Steelyard then' was\n                     then deleted with a full nib in a series of flourishes ending in 'about'\" (page\n                     83n). With this line, Blake shifts to using a lighter\n                     ink. Bentley\n                     reads \"coach\" (Writings volume 2, page 886) instead of\n                     \"coaches\". Phillips reads the final word as \"ride\" but indicates that this reading is\n                     \"conjectured\" (pages 44, 84). Erdman and Bentley see only a three-word\n                     deletion: \"he does not\". Erdman omits the initial ampersand altogether (page\n                     457). Bentley leaves it standing, undeleted (Writings volume\n                     2, page 887). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 887) and Erdman (page 457) both read the last\n                     word of the deletion as \"Envying\". \"kins\" in \"lambkins\" is written over \"s\n                     do\" in \"lambs do\". Bentley reads \"that\" for \"That\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     888). For \"pritty\" Bentley reads \"pretty\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 889). In lines 29 and 31, \"about London / O no\" is legible but deleted \"by\n                     washing out\" (Phillips page 88n). Phillips reads this line\n                     as \"My\", \"written in very pale brown ink\", above \"Nannicantipot\" (pages 47,\n                     88n). But it seems rather to be \"tty\", mirroring the letters just above, in\n                     \"pritty\", and partly erased. In line 31, \"about Matches\" could be replacing the\n                     deleted \"O no\" in the same line and/or the deleted \"about London\" in line\n                     29. \"When\" is washed out but clearly legible above \"Then\", which replaces\n                     it. Erdman reads\n                     the deleted \"sweet\" as \"sweeter\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"?one\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"ll\" (page\n                     459); Bentley does not note the deletion. An erased \"f\", clearly visible before\n                     \"cock\", is the most visible remains of what may be \"This frog\", which was\n                     erased and overwritten with \"Sing co\" in \"Sing cock\" (Erdman page 849n,\n                     Phillips page 90n). The descender of a corrected \"p\" remains\n                     in the middle of \"Sipsop\". Bentley reads \"Sung\" for \"sung\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 891). An illegible\n                     letter or other mark may be deleted between \"Hail\" and \"fingerfooted\". Phillips\n                     reads this as an (undeleted) short dash, \"Hail - fingerfooted\" (page 48).\n                     Bentley and Erdman do not note it. Bentley reads \"widow\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"maidens\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"matrimony\" for \"Matrimony\" and \"how\" for \"How\" (Writings volume 2, page 892).  Erdman reads \"Cynic\" for \"cynic\" (page 460). For \"allways,\" Erdman (page 460) and Phillips (page 51) read\n                     \"always\". The word \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40). In the next line, the letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" are\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41), thus reversing the original order of those\n                     words.  The letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" is\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41). In the previous line, \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40), thus reversing the original order of those\n                  words. The \"s\" at\n                     the end of \"laws\" is made unclear by what may be a spot of ink. Erdman maintains that \"jet\" is \"mended from git\"\n                     (page 850n; also Phillips page 92n). Bentley reads \"give\" for \"gave\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 894). The horizontal line terminates in an area of wash. Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52) read\n                     \"foolish.--\". Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 894) and Erdman (page\n                     462) omit the period after \"louse\". Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52)\n                     read the deleted word at the end of the line, which begins with a legible \"cl\"\n                     and has been both struck through and erased, as \"climing\" (that is,\n                     climbing). Phillips reads a period\n                     after the comma (page 52). Bentley reads \"slides\"\n                     instead of \"sliders\" (Writings volume 2, page 894). Erdman reads a period after the dash (page 462). Erdman reads the deleted \"he\" after \"room.\", less probably, as \"Go\" (page\n                     462). Bentley reads the deletions that begin at the end of line 1 as \"you are\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 895), Erdman as \"you / ar\" (page\n                     462), Phillips as \"gas / --\" (page 55). Beyond the descender on the first word,\n                     the deletions are illegible and the readings speculative. This is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched with\n                     designs, became \"Holy Thursday\" in Songs of Innocence, 1789\n                     (Bentley plate 19). For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 18-20. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     93-94n). This line was probably written in the break between the original stanzas 2\n                     and 3 as a replacement for the final line of stanza 2 (line 21) after Blake had\n                     deleted it. A four-line stanza (lines 23-26) has been\n                     deleted. After it was deleted, the second couplet (lines 25-26) was not reused;\n                     the first couplet (lines 23-24) was rewritten and used to introduce the revised\n                     stanza below (lines 27-30). This unrhymed line is unique in a poem otherwise\n                     written in couplets. Erdman reads \"Cherubim & Seraphim\" (page 850n). Lines 28-31 make up the revised stanza that\n                     replaces the deleted four-line stanza (lines 23-26) and the unrhymed verse that\n                     follows (line 27). A second lowercase \"g\" is written over the original \"g\" in \"among\", perhaps\n                     to strengthen it.  Bentley reads the deletion as \"Mrs Sistagatist\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 896). Bentley reads the deletion as \"Grand\" (Writings volume 2, page 896). \"The voice\" is washed out. These lines\n                     (35-44) make up the opening two stanzas of the earliest known draft of the poem\n                     that, etched with designs, became \"Nurse's Song\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 24). The poem continues on the next page\n                     of the manuscript. For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 94-95n. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     94-95n). The spacing and\n                     lettering suggest that the line originally began \"The tongues\". Blake then\n                     inserted \"When\" before \"The\" and altered \"The\" to \"the\" to read \"When the\n                     tongues\". These two stanzas (lines 1-11) complete the draft of \"Nurse's Song\"\n                     that begins on the previous page (14.35-44). Erdman outlines the sequence of revisions thus: Blake originally wrote\n                     \"cannot go to sleep\", emended it to \"cannot sleep till its dark\", and then\n                     restored the original \"cannot go to sleep\" (page 850n). Phillips describes a\n                     similar sequence, but notes that the original \"go to\" was overwritten by \"get\n                     to\" and \"till its dark\" was added to the line (to read \"and we cannot get to\n                     sleep till its dark\"). Phillips claims that Blake then restored the original\n                     \"go to\" by a supralinear insertion and deleted \"till its dark\" (page 95n). See\n                     note for line 4 for additional information about Blake's revisions to these\n                     lines. Phillips gives a plausible account of the revisions in lines 2-4 that hinges\n                     on the notion that Blake, \"momentarily forgetting the rhyme scheme [abcb]\n                     established in the first stanzas on the preceding page\", wrote line 4, made\n                     some adjustments in lines 2-3, and then recognizing \"his mistake ... restored\n                     the original reading\" of line 3, deleted line 4, and then \"went on to write the\n                     next two lines\" in conformity with the original rhyme scheme (page 95n). Erdman reads a lowercase initial \"s\" in the undeleted \"Sung Quid\" at the end\n                     of the line (page 463). This (lines 13-20) is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched\n                     with designs, became \"The Little Boy lost\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 13). Phillips prints a version of the\n                     poem that displays the differences between this and the etched version (page\n                     96). The word \"turd\" is deleted and replaced by \"tansey\", written in\n                     lighter ink. Erdman reads the beginning of the deletion as \"To hit me\" (page\n                     850n). Erdman reads \"a[ny bird the\"\n                     (page 850n); Bentley \"[\u00e2\u0080\u0083 \u00e2\u0080\u0083d he del]\" (Writings volume 2, page 897); Phillips \"an old\n                        he (page 56). Phillips reads \"began-\" (page 56). The phrase \"leave to\" is presumably a slip for\n                     \"leave me to\". \"O\" is written over \"l\" (probably the start of \"leave\",\n                     conjectures Erdman, page 850n). Two lines (15-16) have been deleted, leaving them only partly legible. They\n                     may read (with Erdman page 850n), \"How many Blackamoors / Coud sing with their\n                     thick lips\". Blake may have originally started line 15 with \"If\" before\n                     changing to \"How\" (Erdman page 850n). Bentley reads line 15 less confidently:\n                        \"If(?) we(?) manage(?)\n                     Blackamoors\" (Writings volume 2, page 898). And there is\n                     considerable uncertainty in the reading of the first word of line 16, which may\n                     be \"Will\" (Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 898), \"Coud\"\n                     (Erdman page 850n), or \"cant\" (Phillips page 59). Bentley reads the opening word of the line as \"thus\" (Writings volume 2, page 899). Phillips reads the deleted word(s) following \"other\" as \"sheet a\" (page 60).\n                     Bentley notes only \"word del\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 899), while Erdman does not note the deletion. Bentley reads \"Sicknackers\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899), Phillips \"Sicknakers\" (page 60). Between \"people\" and \"who\" is a stroke \u00e2\u0080\u0094 probably a false start\n                     \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that Phillips reads as a short dash (page 60). \"abilies\": i.e., presumably, a slip for \"abilities\".\n                     Bentley reads \"abilies\" as \"abities\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899).  \"yo\": i.e.,\n                     presumably, a slip for \"you\". The illegible letters and \"William Blake\" have been\n                  smudged. All of the text in this line has\n                     been smudged. The \"N\" has been\n                     smudged. The gap indicates a partial letter. It may be the backstroke for a capital\n                     letter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 perhaps \"B\". At the beginning of the line\n                     are two partial letters. The first may be a partial capital \"T\" or \"F\". The\n                     second is a small partial stroke. The second legible \"n\" has been\n                     smudged. The text has been smudged. The \"m\" has been smudged. The words \"William Blake\" appear to\n                     have been cancelled.  \"Lamb\", written in a very small hand, is\n                     almost obscured by the first large \"n\". The second \"n\" has been lightly\n                     smudged. The illegible text at the end of the line appears to be a partial\n                     letter\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps \"c\" or \"o\". The illegible text could be the capital letter \"L\" or simply a\n                     squiggle. The letters \"Bl\" (followed by an uncertain letter \"a\") are written in\n                     backwards lettering. They are also smudged. The\n                     text has been smudged, and is written vertically in the lower right quadrant of\n                     the page. The blank verso of this leaf, designated as page B in Bentley and showing a\n                  considerable amount of show-through of the writing on this recto, is not\n                  reproduced here. Two or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time\n                  prior to 1905, between leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). Refer to\n                  the Work Information for more details about the manuscript. A diagonal pencil\n                  inscription at the bottom of the page, not in Blake's hand, reads, \"a leaf is\n                  evidently missing before this one\". At least some of the sketches and lettering on the verso (reproduced here) may\n                  conceivably be the product of both William Blake and his youngest brother Robert\n                  (1762-87). The awkwardness and redundancy of some of the work, the bare geometry\n                  of the head of the large lion(?) in the lower pair of animals in the upper left\n                  quadrant of the page, and the heavy overdrawing on some of the other animals are\n                  among the features that may possibly reflect Robert's attempts to draw subjects\n                  that had been set as exercises for him by older brother William, and, in some\n                  instances, corrected by one of them.The blank recto, designated as page O in Bentley, and showing a considerable\n                  amount of show-through from the ink lines on this verso, is not reproduced\n                  here.",

        "notes": "Bentley designates these as pages 1-16, A, P. Not included here,\n                  among the 18 objects, are the blank verso of object 17 (Bentley page B) and the\n                  blank recto of object 18 (Bentley page O). We are also not including Bentley pages\n                  C-N, all blanks, which are now housed separately from the leaves bearing the\n                  manuscript. Each leaf was originally half of a folio (2 conjugate leaves). Two\n                  or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time prior to 1905, between\n                  leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). The verso of leaf 9 (page B in\n                  Bentley) and the recto of what is now leaf 10 (formerly leaf 16, page O in\n                  Bentley) are blank. These blank pages are not reproduced here. Before rebinding in\n                  1978, there were 6 blank leaves (Bentley pages C-N) of the same paper that bears\n                  the manuscript between what are now leaves 9 and 10 (objects 17-18 as numbered\n                  here). As the sequence of watermarks and countermarks indicates, these blank\n                  leaves were once conjugate with the manuscript. The verso of the final leaf\n                  (object 18 as numbered here and page P in Bentley) bears assorted drawings and\n                  inscriptions. It is included in Butlin's catalogue (no. 149) as \"The Lamb Lying\n                  Down with the Lion and Other Drawings, from 'An Island in the Moon' Manuscript.\"\n                      The watermark appears on leaves 2-8, 10 (objects 3-16, 18 as numbered\n                  here). A countermark, consisting of the letters \"G R\" under a crown, appears on\n                  leaves 1 and 9 (objects 1-2, 17 as numbered here). Object 3 is numbered both 1 and 2 upper left and 5 upper right;\n                  object 5 is numbered 3 upper left and 6 upper right. Objects 7, 11, 13, and 15 are\n                  numbered 9, 6, 7, and 8 upper left. All these numbers are in pencil. They are\n                  probably not written by Blake and thus are not included in our\n                  transcriptions. Each manuscript leaf is mounted\n                  in a paper frame. The present binding was created in 1978; formerly bound in red\n                  morocco with each leaf attached to a stub. The former binding included a\n                  proofsheet of Blake's woodcuts for Robert John Thornton's Pastorals\n                     of Virgil (1821) and a note from A.H. Palmer referring to their\n                  provenance.  Early history not known. Acquired before 1893 by Charles Fairfax Murray; given by\n               Murray to the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1905. A Fitzwilliam Museum collection stamp\n               appears on the verso of the final leaf (object 18 here). Erdman reads the deletion as \"tipsy\" (page 449), Bentley as illegible\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 875), and Phillips as \"tipsy\n                     &\" (page 28). Blake may have first written \"endeavourd\" or \"endeavoured\" before altering\n                     the word to \"endeavouring\". Erdman (page 449) and Phillips (page 28) read \"imagination\" as\n                     \"imaginations\".  Various attempts have been made to\n                     decipher the illegible deletions in lines 24-25. The deletion in line 24\n                     appears to have been an inserted addition following \"Philosophers\" in line 25.\n                     Bentley reads the deletion as \"Quid\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876); Phillips as \"the older\" (page 28); Erdman as \"Quid\" (deleted), replaced\n                     by \"the Older\", mended to \"the Elder\", deleted in turn (pages 450,\n                     849n). \"Inffammable\": i.e., \"Inflammable\" (corrected by Blake,\n                     according to Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 876). In line 32,\n                     the letters \"ee\" in \"see\" appear to have been struck through. A word in line 35, presumably intended for \"Antiquarian\", is\n                     partly covered by an ink spot. A word in line 36, presumably intended for\n                     \"along\", is partly covered by an ink spot. Phillips (page 28) and Erdman (page 450) read\n                     \"outr\u00c3\u00a9\", Bentley \"outr\u00c3\u00a8\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876).  In line 2, the deleted words are probably\n                     \"here the\" (Phillips page 31) preceded by a partially deleted em-dash, but\n                     Bentley reads the deletions as \"----- had the\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 876), Erdman as \"here Etr\" (page 450). In line 4, part of the the \"I\" in \"Inflammable\" has been cut\n                     away. Erdman emends \"staring\" to\n                     \"star[t]ing\" (page 450). \"Obuse\":\n                     i.e., presumably, \"Obtuse\". Erdman (mistakenly) reads an inserted \"said\" just after the deletion\n                     (page 450). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878) and Phillips (page\n                     32) read the deletion as \"and\"; Erdman (page 451) reads it as \"Miss\". Our\n                     reading of \"and\" is uncertain. Phillips reads \"Ma\" instead of \"M.rs\n                     Sigtagatist\" (32). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" instead of \"Sigtagatist\"\n                     throughout (Writings volume 2), but, as Erdman indicates,\n                     \"The name 'Sigtagatist' was first written 'Sistagatist' in most places, but\n                     mended\" (page 849n). In lines 3-7, it is possible that the women's names\n                     replace the deleted men's names, but this substitution is uncertain. Deleted at the end of the line is a phrase, \"All the three Philosophers\",\n                     followed by words that Bentley finds illegible (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878), Phillips reads as \"& very\" (page 32), and Erdman as\n                     \"and the three Philosophers com[in]g\" (page 849n). Our reading of these words\n                     (\"& very\") is uncertain.  In the deletion, Erdman reads \"& Suction\" (page 849n). In the deletion, Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878)\n                     and Erdman (page 849n) omit the \"&\". \"Gibble Gabble the wife of Inflammable\n                     Gass __\" may be part of a larger replacement of women's names for the deleted\n                     men's names in lines 4-6. In the deletion, Phillips omits the \"&\" after \"room\"\n                     (page 32). \"Little Scopprell ... the room\" may be part of a larger replacement\n                     of women's names for the deleted men's names in lines 4-6. \"*Arse\" apparently replaced the deleted\n                     \"Ass\" before both words were deleted and replaced by \"ass_\" (added in light\n                     ink). Erdman, on the basis of the asterisk, restores \"Arse\", to read the line\n                     as \"call me *Arse--)\" (pages 451, 849n). The deletion \"an\" is not noted by Bentley and Erdman. Bentley reads \"would\" as \"wants\" (Writings volume\n                     2, page 878). Bentley reads \"laught\" as \"laughd\" (Writings volume 2, page 878). Bentley reads the\n                     deleted word as \"Comparative(?)\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878). For \"answerd\" (line 31), Erdman reads\n                     \"?exclaimed\" (page 849n). Phillips reads the illegible deletion as \"Miss\"\n                     (page 32); Erdman describes it as a \"short illegible word ending in 'f'\" (page\n                     849n). Phillips reads the deleted phrase (in lines 39-40) as \"of / what you\n                     read\" (page 32), while Erdman reads \"of / what you st\" (page 452). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page 879) throughout. Blake has inserted a\n                     curly bracket that spans lines 10-11. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 880) throughout. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     880) throughout. Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and\n                     Erdman (page 453) read \"Mathematician\". \"why / I know that\" (spanning lines 16, 18) is deleted and then restored (in\n                     line 17) above the deletion and the underscore in line 18. Erdman reads the\n                     deletion as \"?obj Obtuse ?Angle\" (page 849n). The word \"whether\" may be \"whither\". Bentley reads the deletion (lines 31-32) as \"what is this gim(?) used for\" (Writings volume 2, page 849n). For\n                     \"Arsdology\" Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and Erdman\n                     (page 453) read \"Aridology\". Bentley reads \"Hagamy Hatomy\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 881). Erdman reads the deletion as \"Cha\" (page 451) and\n                     Phillips as \"the\" (page 36). Phillips reads the deletion as\n                     \"tw--\" (page 39) and Erdman as \"twen[ty]\" (page 454). Phillips reads the deletion as \"a-\" (page 39). There is a redundant stroke in the first \"p\" of\n                     \"Sipsop\". The deletion (\"bl\") is not noted by Bentley and\n                     Erdman. The heavily deleted words at the end of the line are illegible except for\n                     \"This is\" at the beginning and a lowercase \"f\" midway. Bentley ventures to\n                     decipher \"This is\" (Writings volume 2, page 885); Erdman,\n                     more aggressively, ventures \"This is unfair and ?I ?think\" (page 456). The ink used to delete this line is lighter than the original ink. The illegible deletion is not noted by Erdman. The last word of the line is\n                     \"as\", though Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 885) and Erdman\n                     (page 456) read \"a\" without comment. \"Sopprell\": i.e., presumably, a slip for\n                     \"Scopprell\". \"Gent\" is written over an obscured word\n                     ending in \"man\", deleted by wash. Erdman (page 848) and Phillips (page 43) read\n                     the deleted word at the end of the line as \"Gentleman\". The word \"about\" (an uncertain reading)\n                     is written over text that cannot be recovered. Bentley makes out \"three words del\" (Writings volume 2, page 886),\n                     while Erdman reads \"its a book about\" (page 456). Phillips renders the phrase\n                     as we do here, though he speculates further that the \"first reading may have\n                     been 'Steelyard then' written in light brown ink, evidently the same ink used\n                     to write the first reading 'Gentleman' immediately above. 'Steelyard then' was\n                     then deleted with a full nib in a series of flourishes ending in 'about'\" (page\n                     83n). With this line, Blake shifts to using a lighter\n                     ink. Bentley\n                     reads \"coach\" (Writings volume 2, page 886) instead of\n                     \"coaches\". Phillips reads the final word as \"ride\" but indicates that this reading is\n                     \"conjectured\" (pages 44, 84). Erdman and Bentley see only a three-word\n                     deletion: \"he does not\". Erdman omits the initial ampersand altogether (page\n                     457). Bentley leaves it standing, undeleted (Writings volume\n                     2, page 887). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 887) and Erdman (page 457) both read the last\n                     word of the deletion as \"Envying\". \"kins\" in \"lambkins\" is written over \"s\n                     do\" in \"lambs do\". Bentley reads \"that\" for \"That\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     888). For \"pritty\" Bentley reads \"pretty\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 889). In lines 29 and 31, \"about London / O no\" is legible but deleted \"by\n                     washing out\" (Phillips page 88n). Phillips reads this line\n                     as \"My\", \"written in very pale brown ink\", above \"Nannicantipot\" (pages 47,\n                     88n). But it seems rather to be \"tty\", mirroring the letters just above, in\n                     \"pritty\", and partly erased. In line 31, \"about Matches\" could be replacing the\n                     deleted \"O no\" in the same line and/or the deleted \"about London\" in line\n                     29. \"When\" is washed out but clearly legible above \"Then\", which replaces\n                     it. Erdman reads\n                     the deleted \"sweet\" as \"sweeter\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"?one\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"ll\" (page\n                     459); Bentley does not note the deletion. An erased \"f\", clearly visible before\n                     \"cock\", is the most visible remains of what may be \"This frog\", which was\n                     erased and overwritten with \"Sing co\" in \"Sing cock\" (Erdman page 849n,\n                     Phillips page 90n). The descender of a corrected \"p\" remains\n                     in the middle of \"Sipsop\". Bentley reads \"Sung\" for \"sung\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 891). An illegible\n                     letter or other mark may be deleted between \"Hail\" and \"fingerfooted\". Phillips\n                     reads this as an (undeleted) short dash, \"Hail - fingerfooted\" (page 48).\n                     Bentley and Erdman do not note it. Bentley reads \"widow\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"maidens\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"matrimony\" for \"Matrimony\" and \"how\" for \"How\" (Writings volume 2, page 892).  Erdman reads \"Cynic\" for \"cynic\" (page 460). For \"allways,\" Erdman (page 460) and Phillips (page 51) read\n                     \"always\". The word \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40). In the next line, the letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" are\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41), thus reversing the original order of those\n                     words.  The letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" is\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41). In the previous line, \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40), thus reversing the original order of those\n                  words. The \"s\" at\n                     the end of \"laws\" is made unclear by what may be a spot of ink. Erdman maintains that \"jet\" is \"mended from git\"\n                     (page 850n; also Phillips page 92n). Bentley reads \"give\" for \"gave\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 894). The horizontal line terminates in an area of wash. Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52) read\n                     \"foolish.--\". Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 894) and Erdman (page\n                     462) omit the period after \"louse\". Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52)\n                     read the deleted word at the end of the line, which begins with a legible \"cl\"\n                     and has been both struck through and erased, as \"climing\" (that is,\n                     climbing). Phillips reads a period\n                     after the comma (page 52). Bentley reads \"slides\"\n                     instead of \"sliders\" (Writings volume 2, page 894). Erdman reads a period after the dash (page 462). Erdman reads the deleted \"he\" after \"room.\", less probably, as \"Go\" (page\n                     462). Bentley reads the deletions that begin at the end of line 1 as \"you are\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 895), Erdman as \"you / ar\" (page\n                     462), Phillips as \"gas / --\" (page 55). Beyond the descender on the first word,\n                     the deletions are illegible and the readings speculative. This is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched with\n                     designs, became \"Holy Thursday\" in Songs of Innocence, 1789\n                     (Bentley plate 19). For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 18-20. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     93-94n). This line was probably written in the break between the original stanzas 2\n                     and 3 as a replacement for the final line of stanza 2 (line 21) after Blake had\n                     deleted it. A four-line stanza (lines 23-26) has been\n                     deleted. After it was deleted, the second couplet (lines 25-26) was not reused;\n                     the first couplet (lines 23-24) was rewritten and used to introduce the revised\n                     stanza below (lines 27-30). This unrhymed line is unique in a poem otherwise\n                     written in couplets. Erdman reads \"Cherubim & Seraphim\" (page 850n). Lines 28-31 make up the revised stanza that\n                     replaces the deleted four-line stanza (lines 23-26) and the unrhymed verse that\n                     follows (line 27). A second lowercase \"g\" is written over the original \"g\" in \"among\", perhaps\n                     to strengthen it.  Bentley reads the deletion as \"Mrs Sistagatist\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 896). Bentley reads the deletion as \"Grand\" (Writings volume 2, page 896). \"The voice\" is washed out. These lines\n                     (35-44) make up the opening two stanzas of the earliest known draft of the poem\n                     that, etched with designs, became \"Nurse's Song\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 24). The poem continues on the next page\n                     of the manuscript. For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 94-95n. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     94-95n). The spacing and\n                     lettering suggest that the line originally began \"The tongues\". Blake then\n                     inserted \"When\" before \"The\" and altered \"The\" to \"the\" to read \"When the\n                     tongues\". These two stanzas (lines 1-11) complete the draft of \"Nurse's Song\"\n                     that begins on the previous page (14.35-44). Erdman outlines the sequence of revisions thus: Blake originally wrote\n                     \"cannot go to sleep\", emended it to \"cannot sleep till its dark\", and then\n                     restored the original \"cannot go to sleep\" (page 850n). Phillips describes a\n                     similar sequence, but notes that the original \"go to\" was overwritten by \"get\n                     to\" and \"till its dark\" was added to the line (to read \"and we cannot get to\n                     sleep till its dark\"). Phillips claims that Blake then restored the original\n                     \"go to\" by a supralinear insertion and deleted \"till its dark\" (page 95n). See\n                     note for line 4 for additional information about Blake's revisions to these\n                     lines. Phillips gives a plausible account of the revisions in lines 2-4 that hinges\n                     on the notion that Blake, \"momentarily forgetting the rhyme scheme [abcb]\n                     established in the first stanzas on the preceding page\", wrote line 4, made\n                     some adjustments in lines 2-3, and then recognizing \"his mistake ... restored\n                     the original reading\" of line 3, deleted line 4, and then \"went on to write the\n                     next two lines\" in conformity with the original rhyme scheme (page 95n). Erdman reads a lowercase initial \"s\" in the undeleted \"Sung Quid\" at the end\n                     of the line (page 463). This (lines 13-20) is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched\n                     with designs, became \"The Little Boy lost\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 13). Phillips prints a version of the\n                     poem that displays the differences between this and the etched version (page\n                     96). The word \"turd\" is deleted and replaced by \"tansey\", written in\n                     lighter ink. Erdman reads the beginning of the deletion as \"To hit me\" (page\n                     850n). Erdman reads \"a[ny bird the\"\n                     (page 850n); Bentley \"[\u00e2\u0080\u0083 \u00e2\u0080\u0083d he del]\" (Writings volume 2, page 897); Phillips \"an old\n                        he (page 56). Phillips reads \"began-\" (page 56). The phrase \"leave to\" is presumably a slip for\n                     \"leave me to\". \"O\" is written over \"l\" (probably the start of \"leave\",\n                     conjectures Erdman, page 850n). Two lines (15-16) have been deleted, leaving them only partly legible. They\n                     may read (with Erdman page 850n), \"How many Blackamoors / Coud sing with their\n                     thick lips\". Blake may have originally started line 15 with \"If\" before\n                     changing to \"How\" (Erdman page 850n). Bentley reads line 15 less confidently:\n                        \"If(?) we(?) manage(?)\n                     Blackamoors\" (Writings volume 2, page 898). And there is\n                     considerable uncertainty in the reading of the first word of line 16, which may\n                     be \"Will\" (Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 898), \"Coud\"\n                     (Erdman page 850n), or \"cant\" (Phillips page 59). Bentley reads the opening word of the line as \"thus\" (Writings volume 2, page 899). Phillips reads the deleted word(s) following \"other\" as \"sheet a\" (page 60).\n                     Bentley notes only \"word del\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 899), while Erdman does not note the deletion. Bentley reads \"Sicknackers\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899), Phillips \"Sicknakers\" (page 60). Between \"people\" and \"who\" is a stroke \u00e2\u0080\u0094 probably a false start\n                     \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that Phillips reads as a short dash (page 60). \"abilies\": i.e., presumably, a slip for \"abilities\".\n                     Bentley reads \"abilies\" as \"abities\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899).  \"yo\": i.e.,\n                     presumably, a slip for \"you\". The illegible letters and \"William Blake\" have been\n                  smudged. All of the text in this line has\n                     been smudged. The \"N\" has been\n                     smudged. The gap indicates a partial letter. It may be the backstroke for a capital\n                     letter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 perhaps \"B\". At the beginning of the line\n                     are two partial letters. The first may be a partial capital \"T\" or \"F\". The\n                     second is a small partial stroke. The second legible \"n\" has been\n                     smudged. The text has been smudged. The \"m\" has been smudged. The words \"William Blake\" appear to\n                     have been cancelled.  \"Lamb\", written in a very small hand, is\n                     almost obscured by the first large \"n\". The second \"n\" has been lightly\n                     smudged. The illegible text at the end of the line appears to be a partial\n                     letter\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps \"c\" or \"o\". The illegible text could be the capital letter \"L\" or simply a\n                     squiggle. The letters \"Bl\" (followed by an uncertain letter \"a\") are written in\n                     backwards lettering. They are also smudged. The\n                     text has been smudged, and is written vertically in the lower right quadrant of\n                     the page. The blank verso of this leaf, designated as page B in Bentley and showing a\n                  considerable amount of show-through of the writing on this recto, is not\n                  reproduced here. Two or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time\n                  prior to 1905, between leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). Refer to\n                  the Work Information for more details about the manuscript. A diagonal pencil\n                  inscription at the bottom of the page, not in Blake's hand, reads, \"a leaf is\n                  evidently missing before this one\". At least some of the sketches and lettering on the verso (reproduced here) may\n                  conceivably be the product of both William Blake and his youngest brother Robert\n                  (1762-87). The awkwardness and redundancy of some of the work, the bare geometry\n                  of the head of the large lion(?) in the lower pair of animals in the upper left\n                  quadrant of the page, and the heavy overdrawing on some of the other animals are\n                  among the features that may possibly reflect Robert's attempts to draw subjects\n                  that had been set as exercises for him by older brother William, and, in some\n                  instances, corrected by one of them.The blank recto, designated as page O in Bentley, and showing a considerable\n                  amount of show-through from the ink lines on this verso, is not reproduced\n                  here.",

        "notes": "Bentley designates these as pages 1-16, A, P. Not included here,\n                  among the 18 objects, are the blank verso of object 17 (Bentley page B) and the\n                  blank recto of object 18 (Bentley page O). We are also not including Bentley pages\n                  C-N, all blanks, which are now housed separately from the leaves bearing the\n                  manuscript. Each leaf was originally half of a folio (2 conjugate leaves). Two\n                  or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time prior to 1905, between\n                  leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). The verso of leaf 9 (page B in\n                  Bentley) and the recto of what is now leaf 10 (formerly leaf 16, page O in\n                  Bentley) are blank. These blank pages are not reproduced here. Before rebinding in\n                  1978, there were 6 blank leaves (Bentley pages C-N) of the same paper that bears\n                  the manuscript between what are now leaves 9 and 10 (objects 17-18 as numbered\n                  here). As the sequence of watermarks and countermarks indicates, these blank\n                  leaves were once conjugate with the manuscript. The verso of the final leaf\n                  (object 18 as numbered here and page P in Bentley) bears assorted drawings and\n                  inscriptions. It is included in Butlin's catalogue (no. 149) as \"The Lamb Lying\n                  Down with the Lion and Other Drawings, from 'An Island in the Moon' Manuscript.\"\n                      The watermark appears on leaves 2-8, 10 (objects 3-16, 18 as numbered\n                  here). A countermark, consisting of the letters \"G R\" under a crown, appears on\n                  leaves 1 and 9 (objects 1-2, 17 as numbered here). Object 3 is numbered both 1 and 2 upper left and 5 upper right;\n                  object 5 is numbered 3 upper left and 6 upper right. Objects 7, 11, 13, and 15 are\n                  numbered 9, 6, 7, and 8 upper left. All these numbers are in pencil. They are\n                  probably not written by Blake and thus are not included in our\n                  transcriptions. Each manuscript leaf is mounted\n                  in a paper frame. The present binding was created in 1978; formerly bound in red\n                  morocco with each leaf attached to a stub. The former binding included a\n                  proofsheet of Blake's woodcuts for Robert John Thornton's Pastorals\n                     of Virgil (1821) and a note from A.H. Palmer referring to their\n                  provenance.  Early history not known. Acquired before 1893 by Charles Fairfax Murray; given by\n               Murray to the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1905. A Fitzwilliam Museum collection stamp\n               appears on the verso of the final leaf (object 18 here). Erdman reads the deletion as \"tipsy\" (page 449), Bentley as illegible\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 875), and Phillips as \"tipsy\n                     &\" (page 28). Blake may have first written \"endeavourd\" or \"endeavoured\" before altering\n                     the word to \"endeavouring\". Erdman (page 449) and Phillips (page 28) read \"imagination\" as\n                     \"imaginations\".  Various attempts have been made to\n                     decipher the illegible deletions in lines 24-25. The deletion in line 24\n                     appears to have been an inserted addition following \"Philosophers\" in line 25.\n                     Bentley reads the deletion as \"Quid\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876); Phillips as \"the older\" (page 28); Erdman as \"Quid\" (deleted), replaced\n                     by \"the Older\", mended to \"the Elder\", deleted in turn (pages 450,\n                     849n). \"Inffammable\": i.e., \"Inflammable\" (corrected by Blake,\n                     according to Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 876). In line 32,\n                     the letters \"ee\" in \"see\" appear to have been struck through. A word in line 35, presumably intended for \"Antiquarian\", is\n                     partly covered by an ink spot. A word in line 36, presumably intended for\n                     \"along\", is partly covered by an ink spot. Phillips (page 28) and Erdman (page 450) read\n                     \"outr\u00c3\u00a9\", Bentley \"outr\u00c3\u00a8\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876).  In line 2, the deleted words are probably\n                     \"here the\" (Phillips page 31) preceded by a partially deleted em-dash, but\n                     Bentley reads the deletions as \"----- had the\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 876), Erdman as \"here Etr\" (page 450). In line 4, part of the the \"I\" in \"Inflammable\" has been cut\n                     away. Erdman emends \"staring\" to\n                     \"star[t]ing\" (page 450). \"Obuse\":\n                     i.e., presumably, \"Obtuse\". Erdman (mistakenly) reads an inserted \"said\" just after the deletion\n                     (page 450). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878) and Phillips (page\n                     32) read the deletion as \"and\"; Erdman (page 451) reads it as \"Miss\". Our\n                     reading of \"and\" is uncertain. Phillips reads \"Ma\" instead of \"M.rs\n                     Sigtagatist\" (32). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" instead of \"Sigtagatist\"\n                     throughout (Writings volume 2), but, as Erdman indicates,\n                     \"The name 'Sigtagatist' was first written 'Sistagatist' in most places, but\n                     mended\" (page 849n). In lines 3-7, it is possible that the women's names\n                     replace the deleted men's names, but this substitution is uncertain. Deleted at the end of the line is a phrase, \"All the three Philosophers\",\n                     followed by words that Bentley finds illegible (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878), Phillips reads as \"& very\" (page 32), and Erdman as\n                     \"and the three Philosophers com[in]g\" (page 849n). Our reading of these words\n                     (\"& very\") is uncertain.  In the deletion, Erdman reads \"& Suction\" (page 849n). In the deletion, Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878)\n                     and Erdman (page 849n) omit the \"&\". \"Gibble Gabble the wife of Inflammable\n                     Gass __\" may be part of a larger replacement of women's names for the deleted\n                     men's names in lines 4-6. In the deletion, Phillips omits the \"&\" after \"room\"\n                     (page 32). \"Little Scopprell ... the room\" may be part of a larger replacement\n                     of women's names for the deleted men's names in lines 4-6. \"*Arse\" apparently replaced the deleted\n                     \"Ass\" before both words were deleted and replaced by \"ass_\" (added in light\n                     ink). Erdman, on the basis of the asterisk, restores \"Arse\", to read the line\n                     as \"call me *Arse--)\" (pages 451, 849n). The deletion \"an\" is not noted by Bentley and Erdman. Bentley reads \"would\" as \"wants\" (Writings volume\n                     2, page 878). Bentley reads \"laught\" as \"laughd\" (Writings volume 2, page 878). Bentley reads the\n                     deleted word as \"Comparative(?)\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878). For \"answerd\" (line 31), Erdman reads\n                     \"?exclaimed\" (page 849n). Phillips reads the illegible deletion as \"Miss\"\n                     (page 32); Erdman describes it as a \"short illegible word ending in 'f'\" (page\n                     849n). Phillips reads the deleted phrase (in lines 39-40) as \"of / what you\n                     read\" (page 32), while Erdman reads \"of / what you st\" (page 452). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page 879) throughout. Blake has inserted a\n                     curly bracket that spans lines 10-11. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 880) throughout. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     880) throughout. Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and\n                     Erdman (page 453) read \"Mathematician\". \"why / I know that\" (spanning lines 16, 18) is deleted and then restored (in\n                     line 17) above the deletion and the underscore in line 18. Erdman reads the\n                     deletion as \"?obj Obtuse ?Angle\" (page 849n). The word \"whether\" may be \"whither\". Bentley reads the deletion (lines 31-32) as \"what is this gim(?) used for\" (Writings volume 2, page 849n). For\n                     \"Arsdology\" Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and Erdman\n                     (page 453) read \"Aridology\". Bentley reads \"Hagamy Hatomy\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 881). Erdman reads the deletion as \"Cha\" (page 451) and\n                     Phillips as \"the\" (page 36). Phillips reads the deletion as\n                     \"tw--\" (page 39) and Erdman as \"twen[ty]\" (page 454). Phillips reads the deletion as \"a-\" (page 39). There is a redundant stroke in the first \"p\" of\n                     \"Sipsop\". The deletion (\"bl\") is not noted by Bentley and\n                     Erdman. The heavily deleted words at the end of the line are illegible except for\n                     \"This is\" at the beginning and a lowercase \"f\" midway. Bentley ventures to\n                     decipher \"This is\" (Writings volume 2, page 885); Erdman,\n                     more aggressively, ventures \"This is unfair and ?I ?think\" (page 456). The ink used to delete this line is lighter than the original ink. The illegible deletion is not noted by Erdman. The last word of the line is\n                     \"as\", though Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 885) and Erdman\n                     (page 456) read \"a\" without comment. \"Sopprell\": i.e., presumably, a slip for\n                     \"Scopprell\". \"Gent\" is written over an obscured word\n                     ending in \"man\", deleted by wash. Erdman (page 848) and Phillips (page 43) read\n                     the deleted word at the end of the line as \"Gentleman\". The word \"about\" (an uncertain reading)\n                     is written over text that cannot be recovered. Bentley makes out \"three words del\" (Writings volume 2, page 886),\n                     while Erdman reads \"its a book about\" (page 456). Phillips renders the phrase\n                     as we do here, though he speculates further that the \"first reading may have\n                     been 'Steelyard then' written in light brown ink, evidently the same ink used\n                     to write the first reading 'Gentleman' immediately above. 'Steelyard then' was\n                     then deleted with a full nib in a series of flourishes ending in 'about'\" (page\n                     83n). With this line, Blake shifts to using a lighter\n                     ink. Bentley\n                     reads \"coach\" (Writings volume 2, page 886) instead of\n                     \"coaches\". Phillips reads the final word as \"ride\" but indicates that this reading is\n                     \"conjectured\" (pages 44, 84). Erdman and Bentley see only a three-word\n                     deletion: \"he does not\". Erdman omits the initial ampersand altogether (page\n                     457). Bentley leaves it standing, undeleted (Writings volume\n                     2, page 887). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 887) and Erdman (page 457) both read the last\n                     word of the deletion as \"Envying\". \"kins\" in \"lambkins\" is written over \"s\n                     do\" in \"lambs do\". Bentley reads \"that\" for \"That\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     888). For \"pritty\" Bentley reads \"pretty\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 889). In lines 29 and 31, \"about London / O no\" is legible but deleted \"by\n                     washing out\" (Phillips page 88n). Phillips reads this line\n                     as \"My\", \"written in very pale brown ink\", above \"Nannicantipot\" (pages 47,\n                     88n). But it seems rather to be \"tty\", mirroring the letters just above, in\n                     \"pritty\", and partly erased. In line 31, \"about Matches\" could be replacing the\n                     deleted \"O no\" in the same line and/or the deleted \"about London\" in line\n                     29. \"When\" is washed out but clearly legible above \"Then\", which replaces\n                     it. Erdman reads\n                     the deleted \"sweet\" as \"sweeter\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"?one\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"ll\" (page\n                     459); Bentley does not note the deletion. An erased \"f\", clearly visible before\n                     \"cock\", is the most visible remains of what may be \"This frog\", which was\n                     erased and overwritten with \"Sing co\" in \"Sing cock\" (Erdman page 849n,\n                     Phillips page 90n). The descender of a corrected \"p\" remains\n                     in the middle of \"Sipsop\". Bentley reads \"Sung\" for \"sung\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 891). An illegible\n                     letter or other mark may be deleted between \"Hail\" and \"fingerfooted\". Phillips\n                     reads this as an (undeleted) short dash, \"Hail - fingerfooted\" (page 48).\n                     Bentley and Erdman do not note it. Bentley reads \"widow\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"maidens\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"matrimony\" for \"Matrimony\" and \"how\" for \"How\" (Writings volume 2, page 892).  Erdman reads \"Cynic\" for \"cynic\" (page 460). For \"allways,\" Erdman (page 460) and Phillips (page 51) read\n                     \"always\". The word \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40). In the next line, the letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" are\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41), thus reversing the original order of those\n                     words.  The letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" is\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41). In the previous line, \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40), thus reversing the original order of those\n                  words. The \"s\" at\n                     the end of \"laws\" is made unclear by what may be a spot of ink. Erdman maintains that \"jet\" is \"mended from git\"\n                     (page 850n; also Phillips page 92n). Bentley reads \"give\" for \"gave\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 894). The horizontal line terminates in an area of wash. Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52) read\n                     \"foolish.--\". Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 894) and Erdman (page\n                     462) omit the period after \"louse\". Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52)\n                     read the deleted word at the end of the line, which begins with a legible \"cl\"\n                     and has been both struck through and erased, as \"climing\" (that is,\n                     climbing). Phillips reads a period\n                     after the comma (page 52). Bentley reads \"slides\"\n                     instead of \"sliders\" (Writings volume 2, page 894). Erdman reads a period after the dash (page 462). Erdman reads the deleted \"he\" after \"room.\", less probably, as \"Go\" (page\n                     462). Bentley reads the deletions that begin at the end of line 1 as \"you are\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 895), Erdman as \"you / ar\" (page\n                     462), Phillips as \"gas / --\" (page 55). Beyond the descender on the first word,\n                     the deletions are illegible and the readings speculative. This is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched with\n                     designs, became \"Holy Thursday\" in Songs of Innocence, 1789\n                     (Bentley plate 19). For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 18-20. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     93-94n). This line was probably written in the break between the original stanzas 2\n                     and 3 as a replacement for the final line of stanza 2 (line 21) after Blake had\n                     deleted it. A four-line stanza (lines 23-26) has been\n                     deleted. After it was deleted, the second couplet (lines 25-26) was not reused;\n                     the first couplet (lines 23-24) was rewritten and used to introduce the revised\n                     stanza below (lines 27-30). This unrhymed line is unique in a poem otherwise\n                     written in couplets. Erdman reads \"Cherubim & Seraphim\" (page 850n). Lines 28-31 make up the revised stanza that\n                     replaces the deleted four-line stanza (lines 23-26) and the unrhymed verse that\n                     follows (line 27). A second lowercase \"g\" is written over the original \"g\" in \"among\", perhaps\n                     to strengthen it.  Bentley reads the deletion as \"Mrs Sistagatist\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 896). Bentley reads the deletion as \"Grand\" (Writings volume 2, page 896). \"The voice\" is washed out. These lines\n                     (35-44) make up the opening two stanzas of the earliest known draft of the poem\n                     that, etched with designs, became \"Nurse's Song\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 24). The poem continues on the next page\n                     of the manuscript. For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 94-95n. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     94-95n). The spacing and\n                     lettering suggest that the line originally began \"The tongues\". Blake then\n                     inserted \"When\" before \"The\" and altered \"The\" to \"the\" to read \"When the\n                     tongues\". These two stanzas (lines 1-11) complete the draft of \"Nurse's Song\"\n                     that begins on the previous page (14.35-44). Erdman outlines the sequence of revisions thus: Blake originally wrote\n                     \"cannot go to sleep\", emended it to \"cannot sleep till its dark\", and then\n                     restored the original \"cannot go to sleep\" (page 850n). Phillips describes a\n                     similar sequence, but notes that the original \"go to\" was overwritten by \"get\n                     to\" and \"till its dark\" was added to the line (to read \"and we cannot get to\n                     sleep till its dark\"). Phillips claims that Blake then restored the original\n                     \"go to\" by a supralinear insertion and deleted \"till its dark\" (page 95n). See\n                     note for line 4 for additional information about Blake's revisions to these\n                     lines. Phillips gives a plausible account of the revisions in lines 2-4 that hinges\n                     on the notion that Blake, \"momentarily forgetting the rhyme scheme [abcb]\n                     established in the first stanzas on the preceding page\", wrote line 4, made\n                     some adjustments in lines 2-3, and then recognizing \"his mistake ... restored\n                     the original reading\" of line 3, deleted line 4, and then \"went on to write the\n                     next two lines\" in conformity with the original rhyme scheme (page 95n). Erdman reads a lowercase initial \"s\" in the undeleted \"Sung Quid\" at the end\n                     of the line (page 463). This (lines 13-20) is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched\n                     with designs, became \"The Little Boy lost\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 13). Phillips prints a version of the\n                     poem that displays the differences between this and the etched version (page\n                     96). The word \"turd\" is deleted and replaced by \"tansey\", written in\n                     lighter ink. Erdman reads the beginning of the deletion as \"To hit me\" (page\n                     850n). Erdman reads \"a[ny bird the\"\n                     (page 850n); Bentley \"[\u00e2\u0080\u0083 \u00e2\u0080\u0083d he del]\" (Writings volume 2, page 897); Phillips \"an old\n                        he (page 56). Phillips reads \"began-\" (page 56). The phrase \"leave to\" is presumably a slip for\n                     \"leave me to\". \"O\" is written over \"l\" (probably the start of \"leave\",\n                     conjectures Erdman, page 850n). Two lines (15-16) have been deleted, leaving them only partly legible. They\n                     may read (with Erdman page 850n), \"How many Blackamoors / Coud sing with their\n                     thick lips\". Blake may have originally started line 15 with \"If\" before\n                     changing to \"How\" (Erdman page 850n). Bentley reads line 15 less confidently:\n                        \"If(?) we(?) manage(?)\n                     Blackamoors\" (Writings volume 2, page 898). And there is\n                     considerable uncertainty in the reading of the first word of line 16, which may\n                     be \"Will\" (Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 898), \"Coud\"\n                     (Erdman page 850n), or \"cant\" (Phillips page 59). Bentley reads the opening word of the line as \"thus\" (Writings volume 2, page 899). Phillips reads the deleted word(s) following \"other\" as \"sheet a\" (page 60).\n                     Bentley notes only \"word del\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 899), while Erdman does not note the deletion. Bentley reads \"Sicknackers\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899), Phillips \"Sicknakers\" (page 60). Between \"people\" and \"who\" is a stroke \u00e2\u0080\u0094 probably a false start\n                     \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that Phillips reads as a short dash (page 60). \"abilies\": i.e., presumably, a slip for \"abilities\".\n                     Bentley reads \"abilies\" as \"abities\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899).  \"yo\": i.e.,\n                     presumably, a slip for \"you\". The illegible letters and \"William Blake\" have been\n                  smudged. All of the text in this line has\n                     been smudged. The \"N\" has been\n                     smudged. The gap indicates a partial letter. It may be the backstroke for a capital\n                     letter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 perhaps \"B\". At the beginning of the line\n                     are two partial letters. The first may be a partial capital \"T\" or \"F\". The\n                     second is a small partial stroke. The second legible \"n\" has been\n                     smudged. The text has been smudged. The \"m\" has been smudged. The words \"William Blake\" appear to\n                     have been cancelled.  \"Lamb\", written in a very small hand, is\n                     almost obscured by the first large \"n\". The second \"n\" has been lightly\n                     smudged. The illegible text at the end of the line appears to be a partial\n                     letter\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps \"c\" or \"o\". The illegible text could be the capital letter \"L\" or simply a\n                     squiggle. The letters \"Bl\" (followed by an uncertain letter \"a\") are written in\n                     backwards lettering. They are also smudged. The\n                     text has been smudged, and is written vertically in the lower right quadrant of\n                     the page. The blank verso of this leaf, designated as page B in Bentley and showing a\n                  considerable amount of show-through of the writing on this recto, is not\n                  reproduced here. Two or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time\n                  prior to 1905, between leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). Refer to\n                  the Work Information for more details about the manuscript. A diagonal pencil\n                  inscription at the bottom of the page, not in Blake's hand, reads, \"a leaf is\n                  evidently missing before this one\". At least some of the sketches and lettering on the verso (reproduced here) may\n                  conceivably be the product of both William Blake and his youngest brother Robert\n                  (1762-87). The awkwardness and redundancy of some of the work, the bare geometry\n                  of the head of the large lion(?) in the lower pair of animals in the upper left\n                  quadrant of the page, and the heavy overdrawing on some of the other animals are\n                  among the features that may possibly reflect Robert's attempts to draw subjects\n                  that had been set as exercises for him by older brother William, and, in some\n                  instances, corrected by one of them.The blank recto, designated as page O in Bentley, and showing a considerable\n                  amount of show-through from the ink lines on this verso, is not reproduced\n                  here.",

        "notes": "Bentley designates these as pages 1-16, A, P. Not included here,\n                  among the 18 objects, are the blank verso of object 17 (Bentley page B) and the\n                  blank recto of object 18 (Bentley page O). We are also not including Bentley pages\n                  C-N, all blanks, which are now housed separately from the leaves bearing the\n                  manuscript. Each leaf was originally half of a folio (2 conjugate leaves). Two\n                  or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time prior to 1905, between\n                  leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). The verso of leaf 9 (page B in\n                  Bentley) and the recto of what is now leaf 10 (formerly leaf 16, page O in\n                  Bentley) are blank. These blank pages are not reproduced here. Before rebinding in\n                  1978, there were 6 blank leaves (Bentley pages C-N) of the same paper that bears\n                  the manuscript between what are now leaves 9 and 10 (objects 17-18 as numbered\n                  here). As the sequence of watermarks and countermarks indicates, these blank\n                  leaves were once conjugate with the manuscript. The verso of the final leaf\n                  (object 18 as numbered here and page P in Bentley) bears assorted drawings and\n                  inscriptions. It is included in Butlin's catalogue (no. 149) as \"The Lamb Lying\n                  Down with the Lion and Other Drawings, from 'An Island in the Moon' Manuscript.\"\n                      The watermark appears on leaves 2-8, 10 (objects 3-16, 18 as numbered\n                  here). A countermark, consisting of the letters \"G R\" under a crown, appears on\n                  leaves 1 and 9 (objects 1-2, 17 as numbered here). Object 3 is numbered both 1 and 2 upper left and 5 upper right;\n                  object 5 is numbered 3 upper left and 6 upper right. Objects 7, 11, 13, and 15 are\n                  numbered 9, 6, 7, and 8 upper left. All these numbers are in pencil. They are\n                  probably not written by Blake and thus are not included in our\n                  transcriptions. Each manuscript leaf is mounted\n                  in a paper frame. The present binding was created in 1978; formerly bound in red\n                  morocco with each leaf attached to a stub. The former binding included a\n                  proofsheet of Blake's woodcuts for Robert John Thornton's Pastorals\n                     of Virgil (1821) and a note from A.H. Palmer referring to their\n                  provenance.  Early history not known. Acquired before 1893 by Charles Fairfax Murray; given by\n               Murray to the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1905. A Fitzwilliam Museum collection stamp\n               appears on the verso of the final leaf (object 18 here). Erdman reads the deletion as \"tipsy\" (page 449), Bentley as illegible\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 875), and Phillips as \"tipsy\n                     &\" (page 28). Blake may have first written \"endeavourd\" or \"endeavoured\" before altering\n                     the word to \"endeavouring\". Erdman (page 449) and Phillips (page 28) read \"imagination\" as\n                     \"imaginations\".  Various attempts have been made to\n                     decipher the illegible deletions in lines 24-25. The deletion in line 24\n                     appears to have been an inserted addition following \"Philosophers\" in line 25.\n                     Bentley reads the deletion as \"Quid\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876); Phillips as \"the older\" (page 28); Erdman as \"Quid\" (deleted), replaced\n                     by \"the Older\", mended to \"the Elder\", deleted in turn (pages 450,\n                     849n). \"Inffammable\": i.e., \"Inflammable\" (corrected by Blake,\n                     according to Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 876). In line 32,\n                     the letters \"ee\" in \"see\" appear to have been struck through. A word in line 35, presumably intended for \"Antiquarian\", is\n                     partly covered by an ink spot. A word in line 36, presumably intended for\n                     \"along\", is partly covered by an ink spot. Phillips (page 28) and Erdman (page 450) read\n                     \"outr\u00c3\u00a9\", Bentley \"outr\u00c3\u00a8\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876).  In line 2, the deleted words are probably\n                     \"here the\" (Phillips page 31) preceded by a partially deleted em-dash, but\n                     Bentley reads the deletions as \"----- had the\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 876), Erdman as \"here Etr\" (page 450). In line 4, part of the the \"I\" in \"Inflammable\" has been cut\n                     away. Erdman emends \"staring\" to\n                     \"star[t]ing\" (page 450). \"Obuse\":\n                     i.e., presumably, \"Obtuse\". Erdman (mistakenly) reads an inserted \"said\" just after the deletion\n                     (page 450). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878) and Phillips (page\n                     32) read the deletion as \"and\"; Erdman (page 451) reads it as \"Miss\". Our\n                     reading of \"and\" is uncertain. Phillips reads \"Ma\" instead of \"M.rs\n                     Sigtagatist\" (32). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" instead of \"Sigtagatist\"\n                     throughout (Writings volume 2), but, as Erdman indicates,\n                     \"The name 'Sigtagatist' was first written 'Sistagatist' in most places, but\n                     mended\" (page 849n). In lines 3-7, it is possible that the women's names\n                     replace the deleted men's names, but this substitution is uncertain. Deleted at the end of the line is a phrase, \"All the three Philosophers\",\n                     followed by words that Bentley finds illegible (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878), Phillips reads as \"& very\" (page 32), and Erdman as\n                     \"and the three Philosophers com[in]g\" (page 849n). Our reading of these words\n                     (\"& very\") is uncertain.  In the deletion, Erdman reads \"& Suction\" (page 849n). In the deletion, Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878)\n                     and Erdman (page 849n) omit the \"&\". \"Gibble Gabble the wife of Inflammable\n                     Gass __\" may be part of a larger replacement of women's names for the deleted\n                     men's names in lines 4-6. In the deletion, Phillips omits the \"&\" after \"room\"\n                     (page 32). \"Little Scopprell ... the room\" may be part of a larger replacement\n                     of women's names for the deleted men's names in lines 4-6. \"*Arse\" apparently replaced the deleted\n                     \"Ass\" before both words were deleted and replaced by \"ass_\" (added in light\n                     ink). Erdman, on the basis of the asterisk, restores \"Arse\", to read the line\n                     as \"call me *Arse--)\" (pages 451, 849n). The deletion \"an\" is not noted by Bentley and Erdman. Bentley reads \"would\" as \"wants\" (Writings volume\n                     2, page 878). Bentley reads \"laught\" as \"laughd\" (Writings volume 2, page 878). Bentley reads the\n                     deleted word as \"Comparative(?)\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878). For \"answerd\" (line 31), Erdman reads\n                     \"?exclaimed\" (page 849n). Phillips reads the illegible deletion as \"Miss\"\n                     (page 32); Erdman describes it as a \"short illegible word ending in 'f'\" (page\n                     849n). Phillips reads the deleted phrase (in lines 39-40) as \"of / what you\n                     read\" (page 32), while Erdman reads \"of / what you st\" (page 452). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page 879) throughout. Blake has inserted a\n                     curly bracket that spans lines 10-11. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 880) throughout. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     880) throughout. Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and\n                     Erdman (page 453) read \"Mathematician\". \"why / I know that\" (spanning lines 16, 18) is deleted and then restored (in\n                     line 17) above the deletion and the underscore in line 18. Erdman reads the\n                     deletion as \"?obj Obtuse ?Angle\" (page 849n). The word \"whether\" may be \"whither\". Bentley reads the deletion (lines 31-32) as \"what is this gim(?) used for\" (Writings volume 2, page 849n). For\n                     \"Arsdology\" Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and Erdman\n                     (page 453) read \"Aridology\". Bentley reads \"Hagamy Hatomy\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 881). Erdman reads the deletion as \"Cha\" (page 451) and\n                     Phillips as \"the\" (page 36). Phillips reads the deletion as\n                     \"tw--\" (page 39) and Erdman as \"twen[ty]\" (page 454). Phillips reads the deletion as \"a-\" (page 39). There is a redundant stroke in the first \"p\" of\n                     \"Sipsop\". The deletion (\"bl\") is not noted by Bentley and\n                     Erdman. The heavily deleted words at the end of the line are illegible except for\n                     \"This is\" at the beginning and a lowercase \"f\" midway. Bentley ventures to\n                     decipher \"This is\" (Writings volume 2, page 885); Erdman,\n                     more aggressively, ventures \"This is unfair and ?I ?think\" (page 456). The ink used to delete this line is lighter than the original ink. The illegible deletion is not noted by Erdman. The last word of the line is\n                     \"as\", though Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 885) and Erdman\n                     (page 456) read \"a\" without comment. \"Sopprell\": i.e., presumably, a slip for\n                     \"Scopprell\". \"Gent\" is written over an obscured word\n                     ending in \"man\", deleted by wash. Erdman (page 848) and Phillips (page 43) read\n                     the deleted word at the end of the line as \"Gentleman\". The word \"about\" (an uncertain reading)\n                     is written over text that cannot be recovered. Bentley makes out \"three words del\" (Writings volume 2, page 886),\n                     while Erdman reads \"its a book about\" (page 456). Phillips renders the phrase\n                     as we do here, though he speculates further that the \"first reading may have\n                     been 'Steelyard then' written in light brown ink, evidently the same ink used\n                     to write the first reading 'Gentleman' immediately above. 'Steelyard then' was\n                     then deleted with a full nib in a series of flourishes ending in 'about'\" (page\n                     83n). With this line, Blake shifts to using a lighter\n                     ink. Bentley\n                     reads \"coach\" (Writings volume 2, page 886) instead of\n                     \"coaches\". Phillips reads the final word as \"ride\" but indicates that this reading is\n                     \"conjectured\" (pages 44, 84). Erdman and Bentley see only a three-word\n                     deletion: \"he does not\". Erdman omits the initial ampersand altogether (page\n                     457). Bentley leaves it standing, undeleted (Writings volume\n                     2, page 887). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 887) and Erdman (page 457) both read the last\n                     word of the deletion as \"Envying\". \"kins\" in \"lambkins\" is written over \"s\n                     do\" in \"lambs do\". Bentley reads \"that\" for \"That\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     888). For \"pritty\" Bentley reads \"pretty\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 889). In lines 29 and 31, \"about London / O no\" is legible but deleted \"by\n                     washing out\" (Phillips page 88n). Phillips reads this line\n                     as \"My\", \"written in very pale brown ink\", above \"Nannicantipot\" (pages 47,\n                     88n). But it seems rather to be \"tty\", mirroring the letters just above, in\n                     \"pritty\", and partly erased. In line 31, \"about Matches\" could be replacing the\n                     deleted \"O no\" in the same line and/or the deleted \"about London\" in line\n                     29. \"When\" is washed out but clearly legible above \"Then\", which replaces\n                     it. Erdman reads\n                     the deleted \"sweet\" as \"sweeter\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"?one\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"ll\" (page\n                     459); Bentley does not note the deletion. An erased \"f\", clearly visible before\n                     \"cock\", is the most visible remains of what may be \"This frog\", which was\n                     erased and overwritten with \"Sing co\" in \"Sing cock\" (Erdman page 849n,\n                     Phillips page 90n). The descender of a corrected \"p\" remains\n                     in the middle of \"Sipsop\". Bentley reads \"Sung\" for \"sung\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 891). An illegible\n                     letter or other mark may be deleted between \"Hail\" and \"fingerfooted\". Phillips\n                     reads this as an (undeleted) short dash, \"Hail - fingerfooted\" (page 48).\n                     Bentley and Erdman do not note it. Bentley reads \"widow\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"maidens\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"matrimony\" for \"Matrimony\" and \"how\" for \"How\" (Writings volume 2, page 892).  Erdman reads \"Cynic\" for \"cynic\" (page 460). For \"allways,\" Erdman (page 460) and Phillips (page 51) read\n                     \"always\". The word \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40). In the next line, the letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" are\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41), thus reversing the original order of those\n                     words.  The letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" is\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41). In the previous line, \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40), thus reversing the original order of those\n                  words. The \"s\" at\n                     the end of \"laws\" is made unclear by what may be a spot of ink. Erdman maintains that \"jet\" is \"mended from git\"\n                     (page 850n; also Phillips page 92n). Bentley reads \"give\" for \"gave\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 894). The horizontal line terminates in an area of wash. Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52) read\n                     \"foolish.--\". Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 894) and Erdman (page\n                     462) omit the period after \"louse\". Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52)\n                     read the deleted word at the end of the line, which begins with a legible \"cl\"\n                     and has been both struck through and erased, as \"climing\" (that is,\n                     climbing). Phillips reads a period\n                     after the comma (page 52). Bentley reads \"slides\"\n                     instead of \"sliders\" (Writings volume 2, page 894). Erdman reads a period after the dash (page 462). Erdman reads the deleted \"he\" after \"room.\", less probably, as \"Go\" (page\n                     462). Bentley reads the deletions that begin at the end of line 1 as \"you are\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 895), Erdman as \"you / ar\" (page\n                     462), Phillips as \"gas / --\" (page 55). Beyond the descender on the first word,\n                     the deletions are illegible and the readings speculative. This is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched with\n                     designs, became \"Holy Thursday\" in Songs of Innocence, 1789\n                     (Bentley plate 19). For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 18-20. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     93-94n). This line was probably written in the break between the original stanzas 2\n                     and 3 as a replacement for the final line of stanza 2 (line 21) after Blake had\n                     deleted it. A four-line stanza (lines 23-26) has been\n                     deleted. After it was deleted, the second couplet (lines 25-26) was not reused;\n                     the first couplet (lines 23-24) was rewritten and used to introduce the revised\n                     stanza below (lines 27-30). This unrhymed line is unique in a poem otherwise\n                     written in couplets. Erdman reads \"Cherubim & Seraphim\" (page 850n). Lines 28-31 make up the revised stanza that\n                     replaces the deleted four-line stanza (lines 23-26) and the unrhymed verse that\n                     follows (line 27). A second lowercase \"g\" is written over the original \"g\" in \"among\", perhaps\n                     to strengthen it.  Bentley reads the deletion as \"Mrs Sistagatist\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 896). Bentley reads the deletion as \"Grand\" (Writings volume 2, page 896). \"The voice\" is washed out. These lines\n                     (35-44) make up the opening two stanzas of the earliest known draft of the poem\n                     that, etched with designs, became \"Nurse's Song\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 24). The poem continues on the next page\n                     of the manuscript. For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 94-95n. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     94-95n). The spacing and\n                     lettering suggest that the line originally began \"The tongues\". Blake then\n                     inserted \"When\" before \"The\" and altered \"The\" to \"the\" to read \"When the\n                     tongues\". These two stanzas (lines 1-11) complete the draft of \"Nurse's Song\"\n                     that begins on the previous page (14.35-44). Erdman outlines the sequence of revisions thus: Blake originally wrote\n                     \"cannot go to sleep\", emended it to \"cannot sleep till its dark\", and then\n                     restored the original \"cannot go to sleep\" (page 850n). Phillips describes a\n                     similar sequence, but notes that the original \"go to\" was overwritten by \"get\n                     to\" and \"till its dark\" was added to the line (to read \"and we cannot get to\n                     sleep till its dark\"). Phillips claims that Blake then restored the original\n                     \"go to\" by a supralinear insertion and deleted \"till its dark\" (page 95n). See\n                     note for line 4 for additional information about Blake's revisions to these\n                     lines. Phillips gives a plausible account of the revisions in lines 2-4 that hinges\n                     on the notion that Blake, \"momentarily forgetting the rhyme scheme [abcb]\n                     established in the first stanzas on the preceding page\", wrote line 4, made\n                     some adjustments in lines 2-3, and then recognizing \"his mistake ... restored\n                     the original reading\" of line 3, deleted line 4, and then \"went on to write the\n                     next two lines\" in conformity with the original rhyme scheme (page 95n). Erdman reads a lowercase initial \"s\" in the undeleted \"Sung Quid\" at the end\n                     of the line (page 463). This (lines 13-20) is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched\n                     with designs, became \"The Little Boy lost\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 13). Phillips prints a version of the\n                     poem that displays the differences between this and the etched version (page\n                     96). The word \"turd\" is deleted and replaced by \"tansey\", written in\n                     lighter ink. Erdman reads the beginning of the deletion as \"To hit me\" (page\n                     850n). Erdman reads \"a[ny bird the\"\n                     (page 850n); Bentley \"[\u00e2\u0080\u0083 \u00e2\u0080\u0083d he del]\" (Writings volume 2, page 897); Phillips \"an old\n                        he (page 56). Phillips reads \"began-\" (page 56). The phrase \"leave to\" is presumably a slip for\n                     \"leave me to\". \"O\" is written over \"l\" (probably the start of \"leave\",\n                     conjectures Erdman, page 850n). Two lines (15-16) have been deleted, leaving them only partly legible. They\n                     may read (with Erdman page 850n), \"How many Blackamoors / Coud sing with their\n                     thick lips\". Blake may have originally started line 15 with \"If\" before\n                     changing to \"How\" (Erdman page 850n). Bentley reads line 15 less confidently:\n                        \"If(?) we(?) manage(?)\n                     Blackamoors\" (Writings volume 2, page 898). And there is\n                     considerable uncertainty in the reading of the first word of line 16, which may\n                     be \"Will\" (Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 898), \"Coud\"\n                     (Erdman page 850n), or \"cant\" (Phillips page 59). Bentley reads the opening word of the line as \"thus\" (Writings volume 2, page 899). Phillips reads the deleted word(s) following \"other\" as \"sheet a\" (page 60).\n                     Bentley notes only \"word del\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 899), while Erdman does not note the deletion. Bentley reads \"Sicknackers\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899), Phillips \"Sicknakers\" (page 60). Between \"people\" and \"who\" is a stroke \u00e2\u0080\u0094 probably a false start\n                     \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that Phillips reads as a short dash (page 60). \"abilies\": i.e., presumably, a slip for \"abilities\".\n                     Bentley reads \"abilies\" as \"abities\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899).  \"yo\": i.e.,\n                     presumably, a slip for \"you\". The illegible letters and \"William Blake\" have been\n                  smudged. All of the text in this line has\n                     been smudged. The \"N\" has been\n                     smudged. The gap indicates a partial letter. It may be the backstroke for a capital\n                     letter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 perhaps \"B\". At the beginning of the line\n                     are two partial letters. The first may be a partial capital \"T\" or \"F\". The\n                     second is a small partial stroke. The second legible \"n\" has been\n                     smudged. The text has been smudged. The \"m\" has been smudged. The words \"William Blake\" appear to\n                     have been cancelled.  \"Lamb\", written in a very small hand, is\n                     almost obscured by the first large \"n\". The second \"n\" has been lightly\n                     smudged. The illegible text at the end of the line appears to be a partial\n                     letter\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps \"c\" or \"o\". The illegible text could be the capital letter \"L\" or simply a\n                     squiggle. The letters \"Bl\" (followed by an uncertain letter \"a\") are written in\n                     backwards lettering. They are also smudged. The\n                     text has been smudged, and is written vertically in the lower right quadrant of\n                     the page. The blank verso of this leaf, designated as page B in Bentley and showing a\n                  considerable amount of show-through of the writing on this recto, is not\n                  reproduced here. Two or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time\n                  prior to 1905, between leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). Refer to\n                  the Work Information for more details about the manuscript. A diagonal pencil\n                  inscription at the bottom of the page, not in Blake's hand, reads, \"a leaf is\n                  evidently missing before this one\". At least some of the sketches and lettering on the verso (reproduced here) may\n                  conceivably be the product of both William Blake and his youngest brother Robert\n                  (1762-87). The awkwardness and redundancy of some of the work, the bare geometry\n                  of the head of the large lion(?) in the lower pair of animals in the upper left\n                  quadrant of the page, and the heavy overdrawing on some of the other animals are\n                  among the features that may possibly reflect Robert's attempts to draw subjects\n                  that had been set as exercises for him by older brother William, and, in some\n                  instances, corrected by one of them.The blank recto, designated as page O in Bentley, and showing a considerable\n                  amount of show-through from the ink lines on this verso, is not reproduced\n                  here.",

Not included here,\n                  among the 18 objects, are the blank verso of object 17 (Bentley page B) and the\n                  blank recto of object 18 (Bentley page O). We are also not including Bentley pages\n                  C-N, all blanks, which are now housed separately from the leaves bearing the\n                  manuscript. Each leaf was originally half of a folio (2 conjugate leaves). Two\n                  or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time prior to 1905, between\n                  leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). The verso of leaf 9 (page B in\n                  Bentley) and the recto of what is now leaf 10 (formerly leaf 16, page O in\n                  Bentley) are blank. These blank pages are not reproduced here. Before rebinding in\n                  1978, there were 6 blank leaves (Bentley pages C-N) of the same paper that bears\n                  the manuscript between what are now leaves 9 and 10 (objects 17-18 as numbered\n                  here). As the sequence of watermarks and countermarks indicates, these blank\n                  leaves were once conjugate with the manuscript. The verso of the final leaf\n                  (object 18 as numbered here and page P in Bentley) bears assorted drawings and\n                  inscriptions. It is included in Butlin's catalogue (no. 149) as \"The Lamb Lying\n                  Down with the Lion and Other Drawings, from 'An Island in the Moon' Manuscript.\"\n                      The watermark appears on leaves 2-8, 10 (objects 3-16, 18 as numbered\n                  here). A countermark, consisting of the letters \"G R\" under a crown, appears on\n                  leaves 1 and 9 (objects 1-2, 17 as numbered here). Object 3 is numbered both 1 and 2 upper left and 5 upper right;\n                  object 5 is numbered 3 upper left and 6 upper right. Objects 7, 11, 13, and 15 are\n                  numbered 9, 6, 7, and 8 upper left. All these numbers are in pencil. They are\n                  probably not written by Blake and thus are not included in our\n                  transcriptions. Each manuscript leaf is mounted\n                  in a paper frame. The present binding was created in 1978; formerly bound in red\n                  morocco with each leaf attached to a stub. The former binding included a\n                  proofsheet of Blake's woodcuts for Robert John Thornton's Pastorals\n                     of Virgil (1821) and a note from A.H. Palmer referring to their\n                  provenance.  Early history not known. Acquired before 1893 by Charles Fairfax Murray; given by\n               Murray to the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1905. A Fitzwilliam Museum collection stamp\n               appears on the verso of the final leaf (object 18 here). Erdman reads the deletion as \"tipsy\" (page 449), Bentley as illegible\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 875), and Phillips as \"tipsy\n                     &\" (page 28). Blake may have first written \"endeavourd\" or \"endeavoured\" before altering\n                     the word to \"endeavouring\". Erdman (page 449) and Phillips (page 28) read \"imagination\" as\n                     \"imaginations\".  Various attempts have been made to\n                     decipher the illegible deletions in lines 24-25. The deletion in line 24\n                     appears to have been an inserted addition following \"Philosophers\" in line 25.\n                     Bentley reads the deletion as \"Quid\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876); Phillips as \"the older\" (page 28); Erdman as \"Quid\" (deleted), replaced\n                     by \"the Older\", mended to \"the Elder\", deleted in turn (pages 450,\n                     849n). \"Inffammable\": i.e., \"Inflammable\" (corrected by Blake,\n                     according to Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 876). In line 32,\n                     the letters \"ee\" in \"see\" appear to have been struck through. A word in line 35, presumably intended for \"Antiquarian\", is\n                     partly covered by an ink spot. A word in line 36, presumably intended for\n                     \"along\", is partly covered by an ink spot. Phillips (page 28) and Erdman (page 450) read\n                     \"outr\u00c3\u00a9\", Bentley \"outr\u00c3\u00a8\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876).  In line 2, the deleted words are probably\n                     \"here the\" (Phillips page 31) preceded by a partially deleted em-dash, but\n                     Bentley reads the deletions as \"----- had the\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 876), Erdman as \"here Etr\" (page 450). In line 4, part of the the \"I\" in \"Inflammable\" has been cut\n                     away. Erdman emends \"staring\" to\n                     \"star[t]ing\" (page 450). \"Obuse\":\n                     i.e., presumably, \"Obtuse\". Erdman (mistakenly) reads an inserted \"said\" just after the deletion\n                     (page 450). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878) and Phillips (page\n                     32) read the deletion as \"and\"; Erdman (page 451) reads it as \"Miss\". Our\n                     reading of \"and\" is uncertain. Phillips reads \"Ma\" instead of \"M.rs\n                     Sigtagatist\" (32). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" instead of \"Sigtagatist\"\n                     throughout (Writings volume 2), but, as Erdman indicates,\n                     \"The name 'Sigtagatist' was first written 'Sistagatist' in most places, but\n                     mended\" (page 849n). In lines 3-7, it is possible that the women's names\n                     replace the deleted men's names, but this substitution is uncertain. Deleted at the end of the line is a phrase, \"All the three Philosophers\",\n                     followed by words that Bentley finds illegible (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878), Phillips reads as \"& very\" (page 32), and Erdman as\n                     \"and the three Philosophers com[in]g\" (page 849n). Our reading of these words\n                     (\"& very\") is uncertain.  In the deletion, Erdman reads \"& Suction\" (page 849n). In the deletion, Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878)\n                     and Erdman (page 849n) omit the \"&\". \"Gibble Gabble the wife of Inflammable\n                     Gass __\" may be part of a larger replacement of women's names for the deleted\n                     men's names in lines 4-6. In the deletion, Phillips omits the \"&\" after \"room\"\n                     (page 32). \"Little Scopprell ... the room\" may be part of a larger replacement\n                     of women's names for the deleted men's names in lines 4-6. \"*Arse\" apparently replaced the deleted\n                     \"Ass\" before both words were deleted and replaced by \"ass_\" (added in light\n                     ink). Erdman, on the basis of the asterisk, restores \"Arse\", to read the line\n                     as \"call me *Arse--)\" (pages 451, 849n). The deletion \"an\" is not noted by Bentley and Erdman. Bentley reads \"would\" as \"wants\" (Writings volume\n                     2, page 878). Bentley reads \"laught\" as \"laughd\" (Writings volume 2, page 878). Bentley reads the\n                     deleted word as \"Comparative(?)\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878). For \"answerd\" (line 31), Erdman reads\n                     \"?exclaimed\" (page 849n). Phillips reads the illegible deletion as \"Miss\"\n                     (page 32); Erdman describes it as a \"short illegible word ending in 'f'\" (page\n                     849n). Phillips reads the deleted phrase (in lines 39-40) as \"of / what you\n                     read\" (page 32), while Erdman reads \"of / what you st\" (page 452). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page 879) throughout. Blake has inserted a\n                     curly bracket that spans lines 10-11. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 880) throughout. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     880) throughout. Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and\n                     Erdman (page 453) read \"Mathematician\". \"why / I know that\" (spanning lines 16, 18) is deleted and then restored (in\n                     line 17) above the deletion and the underscore in line 18. Erdman reads the\n                     deletion as \"?obj Obtuse ?Angle\" (page 849n). The word \"whether\" may be \"whither\". Bentley reads the deletion (lines 31-32) as \"what is this gim(?) used for\" (Writings volume 2, page 849n). For\n                     \"Arsdology\" Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and Erdman\n                     (page 453) read \"Aridology\". Bentley reads \"Hagamy Hatomy\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 881). Erdman reads the deletion as \"Cha\" (page 451) and\n                     Phillips as \"the\" (page 36). Phillips reads the deletion as\n                     \"tw--\" (page 39) and Erdman as \"twen[ty]\" (page 454). Phillips reads the deletion as \"a-\" (page 39). There is a redundant stroke in the first \"p\" of\n                     \"Sipsop\". The deletion (\"bl\") is not noted by Bentley and\n                     Erdman. The heavily deleted words at the end of the line are illegible except for\n                     \"This is\" at the beginning and a lowercase \"f\" midway. Bentley ventures to\n                     decipher \"This is\" (Writings volume 2, page 885); Erdman,\n                     more aggressively, ventures \"This is unfair and ?I ?think\" (page 456). The ink used to delete this line is lighter than the original ink. The illegible deletion is not noted by Erdman. The last word of the line is\n                     \"as\", though Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 885) and Erdman\n                     (page 456) read \"a\" without comment. \"Sopprell\": i.e., presumably, a slip for\n                     \"Scopprell\". \"Gent\" is written over an obscured word\n                     ending in \"man\", deleted by wash. Erdman (page 848) and Phillips (page 43) read\n                     the deleted word at the end of the line as \"Gentleman\". The word \"about\" (an uncertain reading)\n                     is written over text that cannot be recovered. Bentley makes out \"three words del\" (Writings volume 2, page 886),\n                     while Erdman reads \"its a book about\" (page 456). Phillips renders the phrase\n                     as we do here, though he speculates further that the \"first reading may have\n                     been 'Steelyard then' written in light brown ink, evidently the same ink used\n                     to write the first reading 'Gentleman' immediately above. 'Steelyard then' was\n                     then deleted with a full nib in a series of flourishes ending in 'about'\" (page\n                     83n). With this line, Blake shifts to using a lighter\n                     ink. Bentley\n                     reads \"coach\" (Writings volume 2, page 886) instead of\n                     \"coaches\". Phillips reads the final word as \"ride\" but indicates that this reading is\n                     \"conjectured\" (pages 44, 84). Erdman and Bentley see only a three-word\n                     deletion: \"he does not\". Erdman omits the initial ampersand altogether (page\n                     457). Bentley leaves it standing, undeleted (Writings volume\n                     2, page 887). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 887) and Erdman (page 457) both read the last\n                     word of the deletion as \"Envying\". \"kins\" in \"lambkins\" is written over \"s\n                     do\" in \"lambs do\". Bentley reads \"that\" for \"That\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     888). For \"pritty\" Bentley reads \"pretty\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 889). In lines 29 and 31, \"about London / O no\" is legible but deleted \"by\n                     washing out\" (Phillips page 88n). Phillips reads this line\n                     as \"My\", \"written in very pale brown ink\", above \"Nannicantipot\" (pages 47,\n                     88n). But it seems rather to be \"tty\", mirroring the letters just above, in\n                     \"pritty\", and partly erased. In line 31, \"about Matches\" could be replacing the\n                     deleted \"O no\" in the same line and/or the deleted \"about London\" in line\n                     29. \"When\" is washed out but clearly legible above \"Then\", which replaces\n                     it. Erdman reads\n                     the deleted \"sweet\" as \"sweeter\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"?one\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"ll\" (page\n                     459); Bentley does not note the deletion. An erased \"f\", clearly visible before\n                     \"cock\", is the most visible remains of what may be \"This frog\", which was\n                     erased and overwritten with \"Sing co\" in \"Sing cock\" (Erdman page 849n,\n                     Phillips page 90n). The descender of a corrected \"p\" remains\n                     in the middle of \"Sipsop\". Bentley reads \"Sung\" for \"sung\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 891). An illegible\n                     letter or other mark may be deleted between \"Hail\" and \"fingerfooted\". Phillips\n                     reads this as an (undeleted) short dash, \"Hail - fingerfooted\" (page 48).\n                     Bentley and Erdman do not note it. Bentley reads \"widow\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"maidens\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"matrimony\" for \"Matrimony\" and \"how\" for \"How\" (Writings volume 2, page 892).  Erdman reads \"Cynic\" for \"cynic\" (page 460). For \"allways,\" Erdman (page 460) and Phillips (page 51) read\n                     \"always\". The word \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40). In the next line, the letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" are\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41), thus reversing the original order of those\n                     words.  The letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" is\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41). In the previous line, \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40), thus reversing the original order of those\n                  words. The \"s\" at\n                     the end of \"laws\" is made unclear by what may be a spot of ink. Erdman maintains that \"jet\" is \"mended from git\"\n                     (page 850n; also Phillips page 92n). Bentley reads \"give\" for \"gave\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 894). The horizontal line terminates in an area of wash. Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52) read\n                     \"foolish.--\". Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 894) and Erdman (page\n                     462) omit the period after \"louse\". Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52)\n                     read the deleted word at the end of the line, which begins with a legible \"cl\"\n                     and has been both struck through and erased, as \"climing\" (that is,\n                     climbing). Phillips reads a period\n                     after the comma (page 52). Bentley reads \"slides\"\n                     instead of \"sliders\" (Writings volume 2, page 894). Erdman reads a period after the dash (page 462). Erdman reads the deleted \"he\" after \"room.\", less probably, as \"Go\" (page\n                     462). Bentley reads the deletions that begin at the end of line 1 as \"you are\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 895), Erdman as \"you / ar\" (page\n                     462), Phillips as \"gas / --\" (page 55). Beyond the descender on the first word,\n                     the deletions are illegible and the readings speculative. This is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched with\n                     designs, became \"Holy Thursday\" in Songs of Innocence, 1789\n                     (Bentley plate 19). For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 18-20. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     93-94n). This line was probably written in the break between the original stanzas 2\n                     and 3 as a replacement for the final line of stanza 2 (line 21) after Blake had\n                     deleted it. A four-line stanza (lines 23-26) has been\n                     deleted. After it was deleted, the second couplet (lines 25-26) was not reused;\n                     the first couplet (lines 23-24) was rewritten and used to introduce the revised\n                     stanza below (lines 27-30). This unrhymed line is unique in a poem otherwise\n                     written in couplets. Erdman reads \"Cherubim & Seraphim\" (page 850n). Lines 28-31 make up the revised stanza that\n                     replaces the deleted four-line stanza (lines 23-26) and the unrhymed verse that\n                     follows (line 27). A second lowercase \"g\" is written over the original \"g\" in \"among\", perhaps\n                     to strengthen it.  Bentley reads the deletion as \"Mrs Sistagatist\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 896). Bentley reads the deletion as \"Grand\" (Writings volume 2, page 896). \"The voice\" is washed out. These lines\n                     (35-44) make up the opening two stanzas of the earliest known draft of the poem\n                     that, etched with designs, became \"Nurse's Song\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 24). The poem continues on the next page\n                     of the manuscript. For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 94-95n. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     94-95n). The spacing and\n                     lettering suggest that the line originally began \"The tongues\". Blake then\n                     inserted \"When\" before \"The\" and altered \"The\" to \"the\" to read \"When the\n                     tongues\". These two stanzas (lines 1-11) complete the draft of \"Nurse's Song\"\n                     that begins on the previous page (14.35-44). Erdman outlines the sequence of revisions thus: Blake originally wrote\n                     \"cannot go to sleep\", emended it to \"cannot sleep till its dark\", and then\n                     restored the original \"cannot go to sleep\" (page 850n). Phillips describes a\n                     similar sequence, but notes that the original \"go to\" was overwritten by \"get\n                     to\" and \"till its dark\" was added to the line (to read \"and we cannot get to\n                     sleep till its dark\"). Phillips claims that Blake then restored the original\n                     \"go to\" by a supralinear insertion and deleted \"till its dark\" (page 95n). See\n                     note for line 4 for additional information about Blake's revisions to these\n                     lines. Phillips gives a plausible account of the revisions in lines 2-4 that hinges\n                     on the notion that Blake, \"momentarily forgetting the rhyme scheme [abcb]\n                     established in the first stanzas on the preceding page\", wrote line 4, made\n                     some adjustments in lines 2-3, and then recognizing \"his mistake ... restored\n                     the original reading\" of line 3, deleted line 4, and then \"went on to write the\n                     next two lines\" in conformity with the original rhyme scheme (page 95n). Erdman reads a lowercase initial \"s\" in the undeleted \"Sung Quid\" at the end\n                     of the line (page 463). This (lines 13-20) is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched\n                     with designs, became \"The Little Boy lost\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 13). Phillips prints a version of the\n                     poem that displays the differences between this and the etched version (page\n                     96). The word \"turd\" is deleted and replaced by \"tansey\", written in\n                     lighter ink. Erdman reads the beginning of the deletion as \"To hit me\" (page\n                     850n). Erdman reads \"a[ny bird the\"\n                     (page 850n); Bentley \"[\u00e2\u0080\u0083 \u00e2\u0080\u0083d he del]\" (Writings volume 2, page 897); Phillips \"an old\n                        he (page 56). Phillips reads \"began-\" (page 56). The phrase \"leave to\" is presumably a slip for\n                     \"leave me to\". \"O\" is written over \"l\" (probably the start of \"leave\",\n                     conjectures Erdman, page 850n). Two lines (15-16) have been deleted, leaving them only partly legible. They\n                     may read (with Erdman page 850n), \"How many Blackamoors / Coud sing with their\n                     thick lips\". Blake may have originally started line 15 with \"If\" before\n                     changing to \"How\" (Erdman page 850n). Bentley reads line 15 less confidently:\n                        \"If(?) we(?) manage(?)\n                     Blackamoors\" (Writings volume 2, page 898). And there is\n                     considerable uncertainty in the reading of the first word of line 16, which may\n                     be \"Will\" (Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 898), \"Coud\"\n                     (Erdman page 850n), or \"cant\" (Phillips page 59). Bentley reads the opening word of the line as \"thus\" (Writings volume 2, page 899). Phillips reads the deleted word(s) following \"other\" as \"sheet a\" (page 60).\n                     Bentley notes only \"word del\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 899), while Erdman does not note the deletion. Bentley reads \"Sicknackers\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899), Phillips \"Sicknakers\" (page 60). Between \"people\" and \"who\" is a stroke \u00e2\u0080\u0094 probably a false start\n                     \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that Phillips reads as a short dash (page 60). \"abilies\": i.e., presumably, a slip for \"abilities\".\n                     Bentley reads \"abilies\" as \"abities\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899).  \"yo\": i.e.,\n                     presumably, a slip for \"you\". The illegible letters and \"William Blake\" have been\n                  smudged. All of the text in this line has\n                     been smudged. The \"N\" has been\n                     smudged. The gap indicates a partial letter. It may be the backstroke for a capital\n                     letter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 perhaps \"B\". At the beginning of the line\n                     are two partial letters. The first may be a partial capital \"T\" or \"F\". The\n                     second is a small partial stroke. The second legible \"n\" has been\n                     smudged. The text has been smudged. The \"m\" has been smudged. The words \"William Blake\" appear to\n                     have been cancelled.  \"Lamb\", written in a very small hand, is\n                     almost obscured by the first large \"n\". The second \"n\" has been lightly\n                     smudged. The illegible text at the end of the line appears to be a partial\n                     letter\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps \"c\" or \"o\". The illegible text could be the capital letter \"L\" or simply a\n                     squiggle. The letters \"Bl\" (followed by an uncertain letter \"a\") are written in\n                     backwards lettering. They are also smudged. The\n                     text has been smudged, and is written vertically in the lower right quadrant of\n                     the page. The blank verso of this leaf, designated as page B in Bentley and showing a\n                  considerable amount of show-through of the writing on this recto, is not\n                  reproduced here. Two or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time\n                  prior to 1905, between leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). Refer to\n                  the Work Information for more details about the manuscript. A diagonal pencil\n                  inscription at the bottom of the page, not in Blake's hand, reads, \"a leaf is\n                  evidently missing before this one\". At least some of the sketches and lettering on the verso (reproduced here) may\n                  conceivably be the product of both William Blake and his youngest brother Robert\n                  (1762-87). The awkwardness and redundancy of some of the work, the bare geometry\n                  of the head of the large lion(?) in the lower pair of animals in the upper left\n                  quadrant of the page, and the heavy overdrawing on some of the other animals are\n                  among the features that may possibly reflect Robert's attempts to draw subjects\n                  that had been set as exercises for him by older brother William, and, in some\n                  instances, corrected by one of them.The blank recto, designated as page O in Bentley, and showing a considerable\n                  amount of show-through from the ink lines on this verso, is not reproduced\n                  here.",

        "notes": "Bentley designates these as pages 1-16, A, P. Not included here,\n                  among the 18 objects, are the blank verso of object 17 (Bentley page B) and the\n                  blank recto of object 18 (Bentley page O). We are also not including Bentley pages\n                  C-N, all blanks, which are now housed separately from the leaves bearing the\n                  manuscript. Each leaf was originally half of a folio (2 conjugate leaves). Two\n                  or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time prior to 1905, between\n                  leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). The verso of leaf 9 (page B in\n                  Bentley) and the recto of what is now leaf 10 (formerly leaf 16, page O in\n                  Bentley) are blank. These blank pages are not reproduced here. Before rebinding in\n                  1978, there were 6 blank leaves (Bentley pages C-N) of the same paper that bears\n                  the manuscript between what are now leaves 9 and 10 (objects 17-18 as numbered\n                  here). As the sequence of watermarks and countermarks indicates, these blank\n                  leaves were once conjugate with the manuscript. The verso of the final leaf\n                  (object 18 as numbered here and page P in Bentley) bears assorted drawings and\n                  inscriptions. It is included in Butlin's catalogue (no. 149) as \"The Lamb Lying\n                  Down with the Lion and Other Drawings, from 'An Island in the Moon' Manuscript.\"\n                      The watermark appears on leaves 2-8, 10 (objects 3-16, 18 as numbered\n                  here). A countermark, consisting of the letters \"G R\" under a crown, appears on\n                  leaves 1 and 9 (objects 1-2, 17 as numbered here). Object 3 is numbered both 1 and 2 upper left and 5 upper right;\n                  object 5 is numbered 3 upper left and 6 upper right. Objects 7, 11, 13, and 15 are\n                  numbered 9, 6, 7, and 8 upper left. All these numbers are in pencil. They are\n                  probably not written by Blake and thus are not included in our\n                  transcriptions. Each manuscript leaf is mounted\n                  in a paper frame. The present binding was created in 1978; formerly bound in red\n                  morocco with each leaf attached to a stub. The former binding included a\n                  proofsheet of Blake's woodcuts for Robert John Thornton's Pastorals\n                     of Virgil (1821) and a note from A.H. Palmer referring to their\n                  provenance.  Early history not known. Acquired before 1893 by Charles Fairfax Murray; given by\n               Murray to the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1905. A Fitzwilliam Museum collection stamp\n               appears on the verso of the final leaf (object 18 here). Erdman reads the deletion as \"tipsy\" (page 449), Bentley as illegible\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 875), and Phillips as \"tipsy\n                     &\" (page 28). Blake may have first written \"endeavourd\" or \"endeavoured\" before altering\n                     the word to \"endeavouring\". Erdman (page 449) and Phillips (page 28) read \"imagination\" as\n                     \"imaginations\".  Various attempts have been made to\n                     decipher the illegible deletions in lines 24-25. The deletion in line 24\n                     appears to have been an inserted addition following \"Philosophers\" in line 25.\n                     Bentley reads the deletion as \"Quid\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876); Phillips as \"the older\" (page 28); Erdman as \"Quid\" (deleted), replaced\n                     by \"the Older\", mended to \"the Elder\", deleted in turn (pages 450,\n                     849n). \"Inffammable\": i.e., \"Inflammable\" (corrected by Blake,\n                     according to Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 876). In line 32,\n                     the letters \"ee\" in \"see\" appear to have been struck through. A word in line 35, presumably intended for \"Antiquarian\", is\n                     partly covered by an ink spot. A word in line 36, presumably intended for\n                     \"along\", is partly covered by an ink spot. Phillips (page 28) and Erdman (page 450) read\n                     \"outr\u00c3\u00a9\", Bentley \"outr\u00c3\u00a8\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876).  In line 2, the deleted words are probably\n                     \"here the\" (Phillips page 31) preceded by a partially deleted em-dash, but\n                     Bentley reads the deletions as \"----- had the\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 876), Erdman as \"here Etr\" (page 450). In line 4, part of the the \"I\" in \"Inflammable\" has been cut\n                     away. Erdman emends \"staring\" to\n                     \"star[t]ing\" (page 450). \"Obuse\":\n                     i.e., presumably, \"Obtuse\". Erdman (mistakenly) reads an inserted \"said\" just after the deletion\n                     (page 450). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878) and Phillips (page\n                     32) read the deletion as \"and\"; Erdman (page 451) reads it as \"Miss\". Our\n                     reading of \"and\" is uncertain. Phillips reads \"Ma\" instead of \"M.rs\n                     Sigtagatist\" (32). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" instead of \"Sigtagatist\"\n                     throughout (Writings volume 2), but, as Erdman indicates,\n                     \"The name 'Sigtagatist' was first written 'Sistagatist' in most places, but\n                     mended\" (page 849n). In lines 3-7, it is possible that the women's names\n                     replace the deleted men's names, but this substitution is uncertain. Deleted at the end of the line is a phrase, \"All the three Philosophers\",\n                     followed by words that Bentley finds illegible (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878), Phillips reads as \"& very\" (page 32), and Erdman as\n                     \"and the three Philosophers com[in]g\" (page 849n). Our reading of these words\n                     (\"& very\") is uncertain.  In the deletion, Erdman reads \"& Suction\" (page 849n). In the deletion, Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878)\n                     and Erdman (page 849n) omit the \"&\". \"Gibble Gabble the wife of Inflammable\n                     Gass __\" may be part of a larger replacement of women's names for the deleted\n                     men's names in lines 4-6. In the deletion, Phillips omits the \"&\" after \"room\"\n                     (page 32). \"Little Scopprell ... the room\" may be part of a larger replacement\n                     of women's names for the deleted men's names in lines 4-6. \"*Arse\" apparently replaced the deleted\n                     \"Ass\" before both words were deleted and replaced by \"ass_\" (added in light\n                     ink). Erdman, on the basis of the asterisk, restores \"Arse\", to read the line\n                     as \"call me *Arse--)\" (pages 451, 849n). The deletion \"an\" is not noted by Bentley and Erdman. Bentley reads \"would\" as \"wants\" (Writings volume\n                     2, page 878). Bentley reads \"laught\" as \"laughd\" (Writings volume 2, page 878). Bentley reads the\n                     deleted word as \"Comparative(?)\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878). For \"answerd\" (line 31), Erdman reads\n                     \"?exclaimed\" (page 849n). Phillips reads the illegible deletion as \"Miss\"\n                     (page 32); Erdman describes it as a \"short illegible word ending in 'f'\" (page\n                     849n). Phillips reads the deleted phrase (in lines 39-40) as \"of / what you\n                     read\" (page 32), while Erdman reads \"of / what you st\" (page 452). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page 879) throughout. Blake has inserted a\n                     curly bracket that spans lines 10-11. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 880) throughout. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     880) throughout. Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and\n                     Erdman (page 453) read \"Mathematician\". \"why / I know that\" (spanning lines 16, 18) is deleted and then restored (in\n                     line 17) above the deletion and the underscore in line 18. Erdman reads the\n                     deletion as \"?obj Obtuse ?Angle\" (page 849n). The word \"whether\" may be \"whither\". Bentley reads the deletion (lines 31-32) as \"what is this gim(?) used for\" (Writings volume 2, page 849n). For\n                     \"Arsdology\" Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and Erdman\n                     (page 453) read \"Aridology\". Bentley reads \"Hagamy Hatomy\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 881). Erdman reads the deletion as \"Cha\" (page 451) and\n                     Phillips as \"the\" (page 36). Phillips reads the deletion as\n                     \"tw--\" (page 39) and Erdman as \"twen[ty]\" (page 454). Phillips reads the deletion as \"a-\" (page 39). There is a redundant stroke in the first \"p\" of\n                     \"Sipsop\". The deletion (\"bl\") is not noted by Bentley and\n                     Erdman. The heavily deleted words at the end of the line are illegible except for\n                     \"This is\" at the beginning and a lowercase \"f\" midway. Bentley ventures to\n                     decipher \"This is\" (Writings volume 2, page 885); Erdman,\n                     more aggressively, ventures \"This is unfair and ?I ?think\" (page 456). The ink used to delete this line is lighter than the original ink. The illegible deletion is not noted by Erdman. The last word of the line is\n                     \"as\", though Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 885) and Erdman\n                     (page 456) read \"a\" without comment. \"Sopprell\": i.e., presumably, a slip for\n                     \"Scopprell\". \"Gent\" is written over an obscured word\n                     ending in \"man\", deleted by wash. Erdman (page 848) and Phillips (page 43) read\n                     the deleted word at the end of the line as \"Gentleman\". The word \"about\" (an uncertain reading)\n                     is written over text that cannot be recovered. Bentley makes out \"three words del\" (Writings volume 2, page 886),\n                     while Erdman reads \"its a book about\" (page 456). Phillips renders the phrase\n                     as we do here, though he speculates further that the \"first reading may have\n                     been 'Steelyard then' written in light brown ink, evidently the same ink used\n                     to write the first reading 'Gentleman' immediately above. 'Steelyard then' was\n                     then deleted with a full nib in a series of flourishes ending in 'about'\" (page\n                     83n). With this line, Blake shifts to using a lighter\n                     ink. Bentley\n                     reads \"coach\" (Writings volume 2, page 886) instead of\n                     \"coaches\". Phillips reads the final word as \"ride\" but indicates that this reading is\n                     \"conjectured\" (pages 44, 84). Erdman and Bentley see only a three-word\n                     deletion: \"he does not\". Erdman omits the initial ampersand altogether (page\n                     457). Bentley leaves it standing, undeleted (Writings volume\n                     2, page 887). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 887) and Erdman (page 457) both read the last\n                     word of the deletion as \"Envying\". \"kins\" in \"lambkins\" is written over \"s\n                     do\" in \"lambs do\". Bentley reads \"that\" for \"That\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     888). For \"pritty\" Bentley reads \"pretty\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 889). In lines 29 and 31, \"about London / O no\" is legible but deleted \"by\n                     washing out\" (Phillips page 88n). Phillips reads this line\n                     as \"My\", \"written in very pale brown ink\", above \"Nannicantipot\" (pages 47,\n                     88n). But it seems rather to be \"tty\", mirroring the letters just above, in\n                     \"pritty\", and partly erased. In line 31, \"about Matches\" could be replacing the\n                     deleted \"O no\" in the same line and/or the deleted \"about London\" in line\n                     29. \"When\" is washed out but clearly legible above \"Then\", which replaces\n                     it. Erdman reads\n                     the deleted \"sweet\" as \"sweeter\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"?one\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"ll\" (page\n                     459); Bentley does not note the deletion. An erased \"f\", clearly visible before\n                     \"cock\", is the most visible remains of what may be \"This frog\", which was\n                     erased and overwritten with \"Sing co\" in \"Sing cock\" (Erdman page 849n,\n                     Phillips page 90n). The descender of a corrected \"p\" remains\n                     in the middle of \"Sipsop\". Bentley reads \"Sung\" for \"sung\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 891). An illegible\n                     letter or other mark may be deleted between \"Hail\" and \"fingerfooted\". Phillips\n                     reads this as an (undeleted) short dash, \"Hail - fingerfooted\" (page 48).\n                     Bentley and Erdman do not note it. Bentley reads \"widow\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"maidens\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"matrimony\" for \"Matrimony\" and \"how\" for \"How\" (Writings volume 2, page 892).  Erdman reads \"Cynic\" for \"cynic\" (page 460). For \"allways,\" Erdman (page 460) and Phillips (page 51) read\n                     \"always\". The word \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40). In the next line, the letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" are\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41), thus reversing the original order of those\n                     words.  The letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" is\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41). In the previous line, \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40), thus reversing the original order of those\n                  words. The \"s\" at\n                     the end of \"laws\" is made unclear by what may be a spot of ink. Erdman maintains that \"jet\" is \"mended from git\"\n                     (page 850n; also Phillips page 92n). Bentley reads \"give\" for \"gave\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 894). The horizontal line terminates in an area of wash. Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52) read\n                     \"foolish.--\". Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 894) and Erdman (page\n                     462) omit the period after \"louse\". Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52)\n                     read the deleted word at the end of the line, which begins with a legible \"cl\"\n                     and has been both struck through and erased, as \"climing\" (that is,\n                     climbing). Phillips reads a period\n                     after the comma (page 52). Bentley reads \"slides\"\n                     instead of \"sliders\" (Writings volume 2, page 894). Erdman reads a period after the dash (page 462). Erdman reads the deleted \"he\" after \"room.\", less probably, as \"Go\" (page\n                     462). Bentley reads the deletions that begin at the end of line 1 as \"you are\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 895), Erdman as \"you / ar\" (page\n                     462), Phillips as \"gas / --\" (page 55). Beyond the descender on the first word,\n                     the deletions are illegible and the readings speculative. This is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched with\n                     designs, became \"Holy Thursday\" in Songs of Innocence, 1789\n                     (Bentley plate 19). For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 18-20. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     93-94n). This line was probably written in the break between the original stanzas 2\n                     and 3 as a replacement for the final line of stanza 2 (line 21) after Blake had\n                     deleted it. A four-line stanza (lines 23-26) has been\n                     deleted. After it was deleted, the second couplet (lines 25-26) was not reused;\n                     the first couplet (lines 23-24) was rewritten and used to introduce the revised\n                     stanza below (lines 27-30). This unrhymed line is unique in a poem otherwise\n                     written in couplets. Erdman reads \"Cherubim & Seraphim\" (page 850n). Lines 28-31 make up the revised stanza that\n                     replaces the deleted four-line stanza (lines 23-26) and the unrhymed verse that\n                     follows (line 27). A second lowercase \"g\" is written over the original \"g\" in \"among\", perhaps\n                     to strengthen it.  Bentley reads the deletion as \"Mrs Sistagatist\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 896). Bentley reads the deletion as \"Grand\" (Writings volume 2, page 896). \"The voice\" is washed out. These lines\n                     (35-44) make up the opening two stanzas of the earliest known draft of the poem\n                     that, etched with designs, became \"Nurse's Song\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 24). The poem continues on the next page\n                     of the manuscript. For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 94-95n. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     94-95n). The spacing and\n                     lettering suggest that the line originally began \"The tongues\". Blake then\n                     inserted \"When\" before \"The\" and altered \"The\" to \"the\" to read \"When the\n                     tongues\". These two stanzas (lines 1-11) complete the draft of \"Nurse's Song\"\n                     that begins on the previous page (14.35-44). Erdman outlines the sequence of revisions thus: Blake originally wrote\n                     \"cannot go to sleep\", emended it to \"cannot sleep till its dark\", and then\n                     restored the original \"cannot go to sleep\" (page 850n). Phillips describes a\n                     similar sequence, but notes that the original \"go to\" was overwritten by \"get\n                     to\" and \"till its dark\" was added to the line (to read \"and we cannot get to\n                     sleep till its dark\"). Phillips claims that Blake then restored the original\n                     \"go to\" by a supralinear insertion and deleted \"till its dark\" (page 95n). See\n                     note for line 4 for additional information about Blake's revisions to these\n                     lines. Phillips gives a plausible account of the revisions in lines 2-4 that hinges\n                     on the notion that Blake, \"momentarily forgetting the rhyme scheme [abcb]\n                     established in the first stanzas on the preceding page\", wrote line 4, made\n                     some adjustments in lines 2-3, and then recognizing \"his mistake ... restored\n                     the original reading\" of line 3, deleted line 4, and then \"went on to write the\n                     next two lines\" in conformity with the original rhyme scheme (page 95n). Erdman reads a lowercase initial \"s\" in the undeleted \"Sung Quid\" at the end\n                     of the line (page 463). This (lines 13-20) is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched\n                     with designs, became \"The Little Boy lost\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 13). Phillips prints a version of the\n                     poem that displays the differences between this and the etched version (page\n                     96). The word \"turd\" is deleted and replaced by \"tansey\", written in\n                     lighter ink. Erdman reads the beginning of the deletion as \"To hit me\" (page\n                     850n). Erdman reads \"a[ny bird the\"\n                     (page 850n); Bentley \"[\u00e2\u0080\u0083 \u00e2\u0080\u0083d he del]\" (Writings volume 2, page 897); Phillips \"an old\n                        he (page 56). Phillips reads \"began-\" (page 56). The phrase \"leave to\" is presumably a slip for\n                     \"leave me to\". \"O\" is written over \"l\" (probably the start of \"leave\",\n                     conjectures Erdman, page 850n). Two lines (15-16) have been deleted, leaving them only partly legible. They\n                     may read (with Erdman page 850n), \"How many Blackamoors / Coud sing with their\n                     thick lips\". Blake may have originally started line 15 with \"If\" before\n                     changing to \"How\" (Erdman page 850n). Bentley reads line 15 less confidently:\n                        \"If(?) we(?) manage(?)\n                     Blackamoors\" (Writings volume 2, page 898). And there is\n                     considerable uncertainty in the reading of the first word of line 16, which may\n                     be \"Will\" (Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 898), \"Coud\"\n                     (Erdman page 850n), or \"cant\" (Phillips page 59). Bentley reads the opening word of the line as \"thus\" (Writings volume 2, page 899). Phillips reads the deleted word(s) following \"other\" as \"sheet a\" (page 60).\n                     Bentley notes only \"word del\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 899), while Erdman does not note the deletion. Bentley reads \"Sicknackers\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899), Phillips \"Sicknakers\" (page 60). Between \"people\" and \"who\" is a stroke \u00e2\u0080\u0094 probably a false start\n                     \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that Phillips reads as a short dash (page 60). \"abilies\": i.e., presumably, a slip for \"abilities\".\n                     Bentley reads \"abilies\" as \"abities\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899).  \"yo\": i.e.,\n                     presumably, a slip for \"you\". The illegible letters and \"William Blake\" have been\n                  smudged. All of the text in this line has\n                     been smudged. The \"N\" has been\n                     smudged. The gap indicates a partial letter. It may be the backstroke for a capital\n                     letter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 perhaps \"B\". At the beginning of the line\n                     are two partial letters. The first may be a partial capital \"T\" or \"F\". The\n                     second is a small partial stroke. The second legible \"n\" has been\n                     smudged. The text has been smudged. The \"m\" has been smudged. The words \"William Blake\" appear to\n                     have been cancelled.  \"Lamb\", written in a very small hand, is\n                     almost obscured by the first large \"n\". The second \"n\" has been lightly\n                     smudged. The illegible text at the end of the line appears to be a partial\n                     letter\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps \"c\" or \"o\". The illegible text could be the capital letter \"L\" or simply a\n                     squiggle. The letters \"Bl\" (followed by an uncertain letter \"a\") are written in\n                     backwards lettering. They are also smudged. The\n                     text has been smudged, and is written vertically in the lower right quadrant of\n                     the page. The blank verso of this leaf, designated as page B in Bentley and showing a\n                  considerable amount of show-through of the writing on this recto, is not\n                  reproduced here. Two or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time\n                  prior to 1905, between leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). Refer to\n                  the Work Information for more details about the manuscript. A diagonal pencil\n                  inscription at the bottom of the page, not in Blake's hand, reads, \"a leaf is\n                  evidently missing before this one\". At least some of the sketches and lettering on the verso (reproduced here) may\n                  conceivably be the product of both William Blake and his youngest brother Robert\n                  (1762-87). The awkwardness and redundancy of some of the work, the bare geometry\n                  of the head of the large lion(?) in the lower pair of animals in the upper left\n                  quadrant of the page, and the heavy overdrawing on some of the other animals are\n                  among the features that may possibly reflect Robert's attempts to draw subjects\n                  that had been set as exercises for him by older brother William, and, in some\n                  instances, corrected by one of them.The blank recto, designated as page O in Bentley, and showing a considerable\n                  amount of show-through from the ink lines on this verso, is not reproduced\n                  here.",

        "notes": "Bentley designates these as pages 1-16, A, P. Not included here,\n                  among the 18 objects, are the blank verso of object 17 (Bentley page B) and the\n                  blank recto of object 18 (Bentley page O). We are also not including Bentley pages\n                  C-N, all blanks, which are now housed separately from the leaves bearing the\n                  manuscript. Each leaf was originally half of a folio (2 conjugate leaves). Two\n                  or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time prior to 1905, between\n                  leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). The verso of leaf 9 (page B in\n                  Bentley) and the recto of what is now leaf 10 (formerly leaf 16, page O in\n                  Bentley) are blank. These blank pages are not reproduced here. Before rebinding in\n                  1978, there were 6 blank leaves (Bentley pages C-N) of the same paper that bears\n                  the manuscript between what are now leaves 9 and 10 (objects 17-18 as numbered\n                  here). As the sequence of watermarks and countermarks indicates, these blank\n                  leaves were once conjugate with the manuscript. The verso of the final leaf\n                  (object 18 as numbered here and page P in Bentley) bears assorted drawings and\n                  inscriptions. It is included in Butlin's catalogue (no. 149) as \"The Lamb Lying\n                  Down with the Lion and Other Drawings, from 'An Island in the Moon' Manuscript.\"\n                      The watermark appears on leaves 2-8, 10 (objects 3-16, 18 as numbered\n                  here). A countermark, consisting of the letters \"G R\" under a crown, appears on\n                  leaves 1 and 9 (objects 1-2, 17 as numbered here). Object 3 is numbered both 1 and 2 upper left and 5 upper right;\n                  object 5 is numbered 3 upper left and 6 upper right. Objects 7, 11, 13, and 15 are\n                  numbered 9, 6, 7, and 8 upper left. All these numbers are in pencil. They are\n                  probably not written by Blake and thus are not included in our\n                  transcriptions. Each manuscript leaf is mounted\n                  in a paper frame. The present binding was created in 1978; formerly bound in red\n                  morocco with each leaf attached to a stub. The former binding included a\n                  proofsheet of Blake's woodcuts for Robert John Thornton's Pastorals\n                     of Virgil (1821) and a note from A.H. Palmer referring to their\n                  provenance.  Early history not known. Acquired before 1893 by Charles Fairfax Murray; given by\n               Murray to the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1905. A Fitzwilliam Museum collection stamp\n               appears on the verso of the final leaf (object 18 here). Erdman reads the deletion as \"tipsy\" (page 449), Bentley as illegible\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 875), and Phillips as \"tipsy\n                     &\" (page 28). Blake may have first written \"endeavourd\" or \"endeavoured\" before altering\n                     the word to \"endeavouring\". Erdman (page 449) and Phillips (page 28) read \"imagination\" as\n                     \"imaginations\".  Various attempts have been made to\n                     decipher the illegible deletions in lines 24-25. The deletion in line 24\n                     appears to have been an inserted addition following \"Philosophers\" in line 25.\n                     Bentley reads the deletion as \"Quid\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876); Phillips as \"the older\" (page 28); Erdman as \"Quid\" (deleted), replaced\n                     by \"the Older\", mended to \"the Elder\", deleted in turn (pages 450,\n                     849n). \"Inffammable\": i.e., \"Inflammable\" (corrected by Blake,\n                     according to Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 876). In line 32,\n                     the letters \"ee\" in \"see\" appear to have been struck through. A word in line 35, presumably intended for \"Antiquarian\", is\n                     partly covered by an ink spot. A word in line 36, presumably intended for\n                     \"along\", is partly covered by an ink spot. Phillips (page 28) and Erdman (page 450) read\n                     \"outr\u00c3\u00a9\", Bentley \"outr\u00c3\u00a8\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876).  In line 2, the deleted words are probably\n                     \"here the\" (Phillips page 31) preceded by a partially deleted em-dash, but\n                     Bentley reads the deletions as \"----- had the\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 876), Erdman as \"here Etr\" (page 450). In line 4, part of the the \"I\" in \"Inflammable\" has been cut\n                     away. Erdman emends \"staring\" to\n                     \"star[t]ing\" (page 450). \"Obuse\":\n                     i.e., presumably, \"Obtuse\". Erdman (mistakenly) reads an inserted \"said\" just after the deletion\n                     (page 450). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878) and Phillips (page\n                     32) read the deletion as \"and\"; Erdman (page 451) reads it as \"Miss\". Our\n                     reading of \"and\" is uncertain. Phillips reads \"Ma\" instead of \"M.rs\n                     Sigtagatist\" (32). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" instead of \"Sigtagatist\"\n                     throughout (Writings volume 2), but, as Erdman indicates,\n                     \"The name 'Sigtagatist' was first written 'Sistagatist' in most places, but\n                     mended\" (page 849n). In lines 3-7, it is possible that the women's names\n                     replace the deleted men's names, but this substitution is uncertain. Deleted at the end of the line is a phrase, \"All the three Philosophers\",\n                     followed by words that Bentley finds illegible (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878), Phillips reads as \"& very\" (page 32), and Erdman as\n                     \"and the three Philosophers com[in]g\" (page 849n). Our reading of these words\n                     (\"& very\") is uncertain.  In the deletion, Erdman reads \"& Suction\" (page 849n). In the deletion, Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878)\n                     and Erdman (page 849n) omit the \"&\". \"Gibble Gabble the wife of Inflammable\n                     Gass __\" may be part of a larger replacement of women's names for the deleted\n                     men's names in lines 4-6. In the deletion, Phillips omits the \"&\" after \"room\"\n                     (page 32). \"Little Scopprell ... the room\" may be part of a larger replacement\n                     of women's names for the deleted men's names in lines 4-6. \"*Arse\" apparently replaced the deleted\n                     \"Ass\" before both words were deleted and replaced by \"ass_\" (added in light\n                     ink). Erdman, on the basis of the asterisk, restores \"Arse\", to read the line\n                     as \"call me *Arse--)\" (pages 451, 849n). The deletion \"an\" is not noted by Bentley and Erdman. Bentley reads \"would\" as \"wants\" (Writings volume\n                     2, page 878). Bentley reads \"laught\" as \"laughd\" (Writings volume 2, page 878). Bentley reads the\n                     deleted word as \"Comparative(?)\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878). For \"answerd\" (line 31), Erdman reads\n                     \"?exclaimed\" (page 849n). Phillips reads the illegible deletion as \"Miss\"\n                     (page 32); Erdman describes it as a \"short illegible word ending in 'f'\" (page\n                     849n). Phillips reads the deleted phrase (in lines 39-40) as \"of / what you\n                     read\" (page 32), while Erdman reads \"of / what you st\" (page 452). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page 879) throughout. Blake has inserted a\n                     curly bracket that spans lines 10-11. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 880) throughout. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     880) throughout. Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and\n                     Erdman (page 453) read \"Mathematician\". \"why / I know that\" (spanning lines 16, 18) is deleted and then restored (in\n                     line 17) above the deletion and the underscore in line 18. Erdman reads the\n                     deletion as \"?obj Obtuse ?Angle\" (page 849n). The word \"whether\" may be \"whither\". Bentley reads the deletion (lines 31-32) as \"what is this gim(?) used for\" (Writings volume 2, page 849n). For\n                     \"Arsdology\" Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and Erdman\n                     (page 453) read \"Aridology\". Bentley reads \"Hagamy Hatomy\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 881). Erdman reads the deletion as \"Cha\" (page 451) and\n                     Phillips as \"the\" (page 36). Phillips reads the deletion as\n                     \"tw--\" (page 39) and Erdman as \"twen[ty]\" (page 454). Phillips reads the deletion as \"a-\" (page 39). There is a redundant stroke in the first \"p\" of\n                     \"Sipsop\". The deletion (\"bl\") is not noted by Bentley and\n                     Erdman. The heavily deleted words at the end of the line are illegible except for\n                     \"This is\" at the beginning and a lowercase \"f\" midway. Bentley ventures to\n                     decipher \"This is\" (Writings volume 2, page 885); Erdman,\n                     more aggressively, ventures \"This is unfair and ?I ?think\" (page 456). The ink used to delete this line is lighter than the original ink. The illegible deletion is not noted by Erdman. The last word of the line is\n                     \"as\", though Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 885) and Erdman\n                     (page 456) read \"a\" without comment. \"Sopprell\": i.e., presumably, a slip for\n                     \"Scopprell\". \"Gent\" is written over an obscured word\n                     ending in \"man\", deleted by wash. Erdman (page 848) and Phillips (page 43) read\n                     the deleted word at the end of the line as \"Gentleman\". The word \"about\" (an uncertain reading)\n                     is written over text that cannot be recovered. Bentley makes out \"three words del\" (Writings volume 2, page 886),\n                     while Erdman reads \"its a book about\" (page 456). Phillips renders the phrase\n                     as we do here, though he speculates further that the \"first reading may have\n                     been 'Steelyard then' written in light brown ink, evidently the same ink used\n                     to write the first reading 'Gentleman' immediately above. 'Steelyard then' was\n                     then deleted with a full nib in a series of flourishes ending in 'about'\" (page\n                     83n). With this line, Blake shifts to using a lighter\n                     ink. Bentley\n                     reads \"coach\" (Writings volume 2, page 886) instead of\n                     \"coaches\". Phillips reads the final word as \"ride\" but indicates that this reading is\n                     \"conjectured\" (pages 44, 84). Erdman and Bentley see only a three-word\n                     deletion: \"he does not\". Erdman omits the initial ampersand altogether (page\n                     457). Bentley leaves it standing, undeleted (Writings volume\n                     2, page 887). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 887) and Erdman (page 457) both read the last\n                     word of the deletion as \"Envying\". \"kins\" in \"lambkins\" is written over \"s\n                     do\" in \"lambs do\". Bentley reads \"that\" for \"That\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     888). For \"pritty\" Bentley reads \"pretty\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 889). In lines 29 and 31, \"about London / O no\" is legible but deleted \"by\n                     washing out\" (Phillips page 88n). Phillips reads this line\n                     as \"My\", \"written in very pale brown ink\", above \"Nannicantipot\" (pages 47,\n                     88n). But it seems rather to be \"tty\", mirroring the letters just above, in\n                     \"pritty\", and partly erased. In line 31, \"about Matches\" could be replacing the\n                     deleted \"O no\" in the same line and/or the deleted \"about London\" in line\n                     29. \"When\" is washed out but clearly legible above \"Then\", which replaces\n                     it. Erdman reads\n                     the deleted \"sweet\" as \"sweeter\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"?one\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"ll\" (page\n                     459); Bentley does not note the deletion. An erased \"f\", clearly visible before\n                     \"cock\", is the most visible remains of what may be \"This frog\", which was\n                     erased and overwritten with \"Sing co\" in \"Sing cock\" (Erdman page 849n,\n                     Phillips page 90n). The descender of a corrected \"p\" remains\n                     in the middle of \"Sipsop\". Bentley reads \"Sung\" for \"sung\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 891). An illegible\n                     letter or other mark may be deleted between \"Hail\" and \"fingerfooted\". Phillips\n                     reads this as an (undeleted) short dash, \"Hail - fingerfooted\" (page 48).\n                     Bentley and Erdman do not note it. Bentley reads \"widow\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"maidens\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"matrimony\" for \"Matrimony\" and \"how\" for \"How\" (Writings volume 2, page 892).  Erdman reads \"Cynic\" for \"cynic\" (page 460). For \"allways,\" Erdman (page 460) and Phillips (page 51) read\n                     \"always\". The word \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40). In the next line, the letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" are\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41), thus reversing the original order of those\n                     words.  The letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" is\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41). In the previous line, \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40), thus reversing the original order of those\n                  words. The \"s\" at\n                     the end of \"laws\" is made unclear by what may be a spot of ink. Erdman maintains that \"jet\" is \"mended from git\"\n                     (page 850n; also Phillips page 92n). Bentley reads \"give\" for \"gave\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 894). The horizontal line terminates in an area of wash. Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52) read\n                     \"foolish.--\". Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 894) and Erdman (page\n                     462) omit the period after \"louse\". Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52)\n                     read the deleted word at the end of the line, which begins with a legible \"cl\"\n                     and has been both struck through and erased, as \"climing\" (that is,\n                     climbing). Phillips reads a period\n                     after the comma (page 52). Bentley reads \"slides\"\n                     instead of \"sliders\" (Writings volume 2, page 894). Erdman reads a period after the dash (page 462). Erdman reads the deleted \"he\" after \"room.\", less probably, as \"Go\" (page\n                     462). Bentley reads the deletions that begin at the end of line 1 as \"you are\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 895), Erdman as \"you / ar\" (page\n                     462), Phillips as \"gas / --\" (page 55). Beyond the descender on the first word,\n                     the deletions are illegible and the readings speculative. This is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched with\n                     designs, became \"Holy Thursday\" in Songs of Innocence, 1789\n                     (Bentley plate 19). For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 18-20. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     93-94n). This line was probably written in the break between the original stanzas 2\n                     and 3 as a replacement for the final line of stanza 2 (line 21) after Blake had\n                     deleted it. A four-line stanza (lines 23-26) has been\n                     deleted. After it was deleted, the second couplet (lines 25-26) was not reused;\n                     the first couplet (lines 23-24) was rewritten and used to introduce the revised\n                     stanza below (lines 27-30). This unrhymed line is unique in a poem otherwise\n                     written in couplets. Erdman reads \"Cherubim & Seraphim\" (page 850n). Lines 28-31 make up the revised stanza that\n                     replaces the deleted four-line stanza (lines 23-26) and the unrhymed verse that\n                     follows (line 27). A second lowercase \"g\" is written over the original \"g\" in \"among\", perhaps\n                     to strengthen it.  Bentley reads the deletion as \"Mrs Sistagatist\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 896). Bentley reads the deletion as \"Grand\" (Writings volume 2, page 896). \"The voice\" is washed out. These lines\n                     (35-44) make up the opening two stanzas of the earliest known draft of the poem\n                     that, etched with designs, became \"Nurse's Song\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 24). The poem continues on the next page\n                     of the manuscript. For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 94-95n. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     94-95n). The spacing and\n                     lettering suggest that the line originally began \"The tongues\". Blake then\n                     inserted \"When\" before \"The\" and altered \"The\" to \"the\" to read \"When the\n                     tongues\". These two stanzas (lines 1-11) complete the draft of \"Nurse's Song\"\n                     that begins on the previous page (14.35-44). Erdman outlines the sequence of revisions thus: Blake originally wrote\n                     \"cannot go to sleep\", emended it to \"cannot sleep till its dark\", and then\n                     restored the original \"cannot go to sleep\" (page 850n). Phillips describes a\n                     similar sequence, but notes that the original \"go to\" was overwritten by \"get\n                     to\" and \"till its dark\" was added to the line (to read \"and we cannot get to\n                     sleep till its dark\"). Phillips claims that Blake then restored the original\n                     \"go to\" by a supralinear insertion and deleted \"till its dark\" (page 95n). See\n                     note for line 4 for additional information about Blake's revisions to these\n                     lines. Phillips gives a plausible account of the revisions in lines 2-4 that hinges\n                     on the notion that Blake, \"momentarily forgetting the rhyme scheme [abcb]\n                     established in the first stanzas on the preceding page\", wrote line 4, made\n                     some adjustments in lines 2-3, and then recognizing \"his mistake ... restored\n                     the original reading\" of line 3, deleted line 4, and then \"went on to write the\n                     next two lines\" in conformity with the original rhyme scheme (page 95n). Erdman reads a lowercase initial \"s\" in the undeleted \"Sung Quid\" at the end\n                     of the line (page 463). This (lines 13-20) is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched\n                     with designs, became \"The Little Boy lost\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 13). Phillips prints a version of the\n                     poem that displays the differences between this and the etched version (page\n                     96). The word \"turd\" is deleted and replaced by \"tansey\", written in\n                     lighter ink. Erdman reads the beginning of the deletion as \"To hit me\" (page\n                     850n). Erdman reads \"a[ny bird the\"\n                     (page 850n); Bentley \"[\u00e2\u0080\u0083 \u00e2\u0080\u0083d he del]\" (Writings volume 2, page 897); Phillips \"an old\n                        he (page 56). Phillips reads \"began-\" (page 56). The phrase \"leave to\" is presumably a slip for\n                     \"leave me to\". \"O\" is written over \"l\" (probably the start of \"leave\",\n                     conjectures Erdman, page 850n). Two lines (15-16) have been deleted, leaving them only partly legible. They\n                     may read (with Erdman page 850n), \"How many Blackamoors / Coud sing with their\n                     thick lips\". Blake may have originally started line 15 with \"If\" before\n                     changing to \"How\" (Erdman page 850n). Bentley reads line 15 less confidently:\n                        \"If(?) we(?) manage(?)\n                     Blackamoors\" (Writings volume 2, page 898). And there is\n                     considerable uncertainty in the reading of the first word of line 16, which may\n                     be \"Will\" (Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 898), \"Coud\"\n                     (Erdman page 850n), or \"cant\" (Phillips page 59). Bentley reads the opening word of the line as \"thus\" (Writings volume 2, page 899). Phillips reads the deleted word(s) following \"other\" as \"sheet a\" (page 60).\n                     Bentley notes only \"word del\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 899), while Erdman does not note the deletion. Bentley reads \"Sicknackers\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899), Phillips \"Sicknakers\" (page 60). Between \"people\" and \"who\" is a stroke \u00e2\u0080\u0094 probably a false start\n                     \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that Phillips reads as a short dash (page 60). \"abilies\": i.e., presumably, a slip for \"abilities\".\n                     Bentley reads \"abilies\" as \"abities\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899).  \"yo\": i.e.,\n                     presumably, a slip for \"you\". The illegible letters and \"William Blake\" have been\n                  smudged. All of the text in this line has\n                     been smudged. The \"N\" has been\n                     smudged. The gap indicates a partial letter. It may be the backstroke for a capital\n                     letter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 perhaps \"B\". At the beginning of the line\n                     are two partial letters. The first may be a partial capital \"T\" or \"F\". The\n                     second is a small partial stroke. The second legible \"n\" has been\n                     smudged. The text has been smudged. The \"m\" has been smudged. The words \"William Blake\" appear to\n                     have been cancelled.  \"Lamb\", written in a very small hand, is\n                     almost obscured by the first large \"n\". The second \"n\" has been lightly\n                     smudged. The illegible text at the end of the line appears to be a partial\n                     letter\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps \"c\" or \"o\". The illegible text could be the capital letter \"L\" or simply a\n                     squiggle. The letters \"Bl\" (followed by an uncertain letter \"a\") are written in\n                     backwards lettering. They are also smudged. The\n                     text has been smudged, and is written vertically in the lower right quadrant of\n                     the page. The blank verso of this leaf, designated as page B in Bentley and showing a\n                  considerable amount of show-through of the writing on this recto, is not\n                  reproduced here. Two or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time\n                  prior to 1905, between leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). Refer to\n                  the Work Information for more details about the manuscript. A diagonal pencil\n                  inscription at the bottom of the page, not in Blake's hand, reads, \"a leaf is\n                  evidently missing before this one\". At least some of the sketches and lettering on the verso (reproduced here) may\n                  conceivably be the product of both William Blake and his youngest brother Robert\n                  (1762-87). The awkwardness and redundancy of some of the work, the bare geometry\n                  of the head of the large lion(?) in the lower pair of animals in the upper left\n                  quadrant of the page, and the heavy overdrawing on some of the other animals are\n                  among the features that may possibly reflect Robert's attempts to draw subjects\n                  that had been set as exercises for him by older brother William, and, in some\n                  instances, corrected by one of them.The blank recto, designated as page O in Bentley, and showing a considerable\n                  amount of show-through from the ink lines on this verso, is not reproduced\n                  here.",

        "notes": "Bentley designates these as pages 1-16, A, P. Not included here,\n                  among the 18 objects, are the blank verso of object 17 (Bentley page B) and the\n                  blank recto of object 18 (Bentley page O). We are also not including Bentley pages\n                  C-N, all blanks, which are now housed separately from the leaves bearing the\n                  manuscript. Each leaf was originally half of a folio (2 conjugate leaves). Two\n                  or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time prior to 1905, between\n                  leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). The verso of leaf 9 (page B in\n                  Bentley) and the recto of what is now leaf 10 (formerly leaf 16, page O in\n                  Bentley) are blank. These blank pages are not reproduced here. Before rebinding in\n                  1978, there were 6 blank leaves (Bentley pages C-N) of the same paper that bears\n                  the manuscript between what are now leaves 9 and 10 (objects 17-18 as numbered\n                  here). As the sequence of watermarks and countermarks indicates, these blank\n                  leaves were once conjugate with the manuscript. The verso of the final leaf\n                  (object 18 as numbered here and page P in Bentley) bears assorted drawings and\n                  inscriptions. It is included in Butlin's catalogue (no. 149) as \"The Lamb Lying\n                  Down with the Lion and Other Drawings, from 'An Island in the Moon' Manuscript.\"\n                      The watermark appears on leaves 2-8, 10 (objects 3-16, 18 as numbered\n                  here). A countermark, consisting of the letters \"G R\" under a crown, appears on\n                  leaves 1 and 9 (objects 1-2, 17 as numbered here). Object 3 is numbered both 1 and 2 upper left and 5 upper right;\n                  object 5 is numbered 3 upper left and 6 upper right. Objects 7, 11, 13, and 15 are\n                  numbered 9, 6, 7, and 8 upper left. All these numbers are in pencil. They are\n                  probably not written by Blake and thus are not included in our\n                  transcriptions. Each manuscript leaf is mounted\n                  in a paper frame. The present binding was created in 1978; formerly bound in red\n                  morocco with each leaf attached to a stub. The former binding included a\n                  proofsheet of Blake's woodcuts for Robert John Thornton's Pastorals\n                     of Virgil (1821) and a note from A.H. Palmer referring to their\n                  provenance.  Early history not known. Acquired before 1893 by Charles Fairfax Murray; given by\n               Murray to the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1905. A Fitzwilliam Museum collection stamp\n               appears on the verso of the final leaf (object 18 here). Erdman reads the deletion as \"tipsy\" (page 449), Bentley as illegible\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 875), and Phillips as \"tipsy\n                     &\" (page 28). Blake may have first written \"endeavourd\" or \"endeavoured\" before altering\n                     the word to \"endeavouring\". Erdman (page 449) and Phillips (page 28) read \"imagination\" as\n                     \"imaginations\".  Various attempts have been made to\n                     decipher the illegible deletions in lines 24-25. The deletion in line 24\n                     appears to have been an inserted addition following \"Philosophers\" in line 25.\n                     Bentley reads the deletion as \"Quid\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876); Phillips as \"the older\" (page 28); Erdman as \"Quid\" (deleted), replaced\n                     by \"the Older\", mended to \"the Elder\", deleted in turn (pages 450,\n                     849n). \"Inffammable\": i.e., \"Inflammable\" (corrected by Blake,\n                     according to Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 876). In line 32,\n                     the letters \"ee\" in \"see\" appear to have been struck through. A word in line 35, presumably intended for \"Antiquarian\", is\n                     partly covered by an ink spot. A word in line 36, presumably intended for\n                     \"along\", is partly covered by an ink spot. Phillips (page 28) and Erdman (page 450) read\n                     \"outr\u00c3\u00a9\", Bentley \"outr\u00c3\u00a8\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876).  In line 2, the deleted words are probably\n                     \"here the\" (Phillips page 31) preceded by a partially deleted em-dash, but\n                     Bentley reads the deletions as \"----- had the\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 876), Erdman as \"here Etr\" (page 450). In line 4, part of the the \"I\" in \"Inflammable\" has been cut\n                     away. Erdman emends \"staring\" to\n                     \"star[t]ing\" (page 450). \"Obuse\":\n                     i.e., presumably, \"Obtuse\". Erdman (mistakenly) reads an inserted \"said\" just after the deletion\n                     (page 450). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878) and Phillips (page\n                     32) read the deletion as \"and\"; Erdman (page 451) reads it as \"Miss\". Our\n                     reading of \"and\" is uncertain. Phillips reads \"Ma\" instead of \"M.rs\n                     Sigtagatist\" (32). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" instead of \"Sigtagatist\"\n                     throughout (Writings volume 2), but, as Erdman indicates,\n                     \"The name 'Sigtagatist' was first written 'Sistagatist' in most places, but\n                     mended\" (page 849n). In lines 3-7, it is possible that the women's names\n                     replace the deleted men's names, but this substitution is uncertain. Deleted at the end of the line is a phrase, \"All the three Philosophers\",\n                     followed by words that Bentley finds illegible (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878), Phillips reads as \"& very\" (page 32), and Erdman as\n                     \"and the three Philosophers com[in]g\" (page 849n). Our reading of these words\n                     (\"& very\") is uncertain.  In the deletion, Erdman reads \"& Suction\" (page 849n). In the deletion, Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878)\n                     and Erdman (page 849n) omit the \"&\". \"Gibble Gabble the wife of Inflammable\n                     Gass __\" may be part of a larger replacement of women's names for the deleted\n                     men's names in lines 4-6. In the deletion, Phillips omits the \"&\" after \"room\"\n                     (page 32). \"Little Scopprell ... the room\" may be part of a larger replacement\n                     of women's names for the deleted men's names in lines 4-6. \"*Arse\" apparently replaced the deleted\n                     \"Ass\" before both words were deleted and replaced by \"ass_\" (added in light\n                     ink). Erdman, on the basis of the asterisk, restores \"Arse\", to read the line\n                     as \"call me *Arse--)\" (pages 451, 849n). The deletion \"an\" is not noted by Bentley and Erdman. Bentley reads \"would\" as \"wants\" (Writings volume\n                     2, page 878). Bentley reads \"laught\" as \"laughd\" (Writings volume 2, page 878). Bentley reads the\n                     deleted word as \"Comparative(?)\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878). For \"answerd\" (line 31), Erdman reads\n                     \"?exclaimed\" (page 849n). Phillips reads the illegible deletion as \"Miss\"\n                     (page 32); Erdman describes it as a \"short illegible word ending in 'f'\" (page\n                     849n). Phillips reads the deleted phrase (in lines 39-40) as \"of / what you\n                     read\" (page 32), while Erdman reads \"of / what you st\" (page 452). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page 879) throughout. Blake has inserted a\n                     curly bracket that spans lines 10-11. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 880) throughout. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     880) throughout. Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and\n                     Erdman (page 453) read \"Mathematician\". \"why / I know that\" (spanning lines 16, 18) is deleted and then restored (in\n                     line 17) above the deletion and the underscore in line 18. Erdman reads the\n                     deletion as \"?obj Obtuse ?Angle\" (page 849n). The word \"whether\" may be \"whither\". Bentley reads the deletion (lines 31-32) as \"what is this gim(?) used for\" (Writings volume 2, page 849n). For\n                     \"Arsdology\" Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and Erdman\n                     (page 453) read \"Aridology\". Bentley reads \"Hagamy Hatomy\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 881). Erdman reads the deletion as \"Cha\" (page 451) and\n                     Phillips as \"the\" (page 36). Phillips reads the deletion as\n                     \"tw--\" (page 39) and Erdman as \"twen[ty]\" (page 454). Phillips reads the deletion as \"a-\" (page 39). There is a redundant stroke in the first \"p\" of\n                     \"Sipsop\". The deletion (\"bl\") is not noted by Bentley and\n                     Erdman. The heavily deleted words at the end of the line are illegible except for\n                     \"This is\" at the beginning and a lowercase \"f\" midway. Bentley ventures to\n                     decipher \"This is\" (Writings volume 2, page 885); Erdman,\n                     more aggressively, ventures \"This is unfair and ?I ?think\" (page 456). The ink used to delete this line is lighter than the original ink. The illegible deletion is not noted by Erdman. The last word of the line is\n                     \"as\", though Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 885) and Erdman\n                     (page 456) read \"a\" without comment. \"Sopprell\": i.e., presumably, a slip for\n                     \"Scopprell\". \"Gent\" is written over an obscured word\n                     ending in \"man\", deleted by wash. Erdman (page 848) and Phillips (page 43) read\n                     the deleted word at the end of the line as \"Gentleman\". The word \"about\" (an uncertain reading)\n                     is written over text that cannot be recovered. Bentley makes out \"three words del\" (Writings volume 2, page 886),\n                     while Erdman reads \"its a book about\" (page 456). Phillips renders the phrase\n                     as we do here, though he speculates further that the \"first reading may have\n                     been 'Steelyard then' written in light brown ink, evidently the same ink used\n                     to write the first reading 'Gentleman' immediately above. 'Steelyard then' was\n                     then deleted with a full nib in a series of flourishes ending in 'about'\" (page\n                     83n). With this line, Blake shifts to using a lighter\n                     ink. Bentley\n                     reads \"coach\" (Writings volume 2, page 886) instead of\n                     \"coaches\". Phillips reads the final word as \"ride\" but indicates that this reading is\n                     \"conjectured\" (pages 44, 84). Erdman and Bentley see only a three-word\n                     deletion: \"he does not\". Erdman omits the initial ampersand altogether (page\n                     457). Bentley leaves it standing, undeleted (Writings volume\n                     2, page 887). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 887) and Erdman (page 457) both read the last\n                     word of the deletion as \"Envying\". \"kins\" in \"lambkins\" is written over \"s\n                     do\" in \"lambs do\". Bentley reads \"that\" for \"That\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     888). For \"pritty\" Bentley reads \"pretty\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 889). In lines 29 and 31, \"about London / O no\" is legible but deleted \"by\n                     washing out\" (Phillips page 88n). Phillips reads this line\n                     as \"My\", \"written in very pale brown ink\", above \"Nannicantipot\" (pages 47,\n                     88n). But it seems rather to be \"tty\", mirroring the letters just above, in\n                     \"pritty\", and partly erased. In line 31, \"about Matches\" could be replacing the\n                     deleted \"O no\" in the same line and/or the deleted \"about London\" in line\n                     29. \"When\" is washed out but clearly legible above \"Then\", which replaces\n                     it. Erdman reads\n                     the deleted \"sweet\" as \"sweeter\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"?one\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"ll\" (page\n                     459); Bentley does not note the deletion. An erased \"f\", clearly visible before\n                     \"cock\", is the most visible remains of what may be \"This frog\", which was\n                     erased and overwritten with \"Sing co\" in \"Sing cock\" (Erdman page 849n,\n                     Phillips page 90n). The descender of a corrected \"p\" remains\n                     in the middle of \"Sipsop\". Bentley reads \"Sung\" for \"sung\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 891). An illegible\n                     letter or other mark may be deleted between \"Hail\" and \"fingerfooted\". Phillips\n                     reads this as an (undeleted) short dash, \"Hail - fingerfooted\" (page 48).\n                     Bentley and Erdman do not note it. Bentley reads \"widow\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"maidens\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"matrimony\" for \"Matrimony\" and \"how\" for \"How\" (Writings volume 2, page 892).  Erdman reads \"Cynic\" for \"cynic\" (page 460). For \"allways,\" Erdman (page 460) and Phillips (page 51) read\n                     \"always\". The word \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40). In the next line, the letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" are\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41), thus reversing the original order of those\n                     words.  The letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" is\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41). In the previous line, \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40), thus reversing the original order of those\n                  words. The \"s\" at\n                     the end of \"laws\" is made unclear by what may be a spot of ink. Erdman maintains that \"jet\" is \"mended from git\"\n                     (page 850n; also Phillips page 92n). Bentley reads \"give\" for \"gave\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 894). The horizontal line terminates in an area of wash. Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52) read\n                     \"foolish.--\". Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 894) and Erdman (page\n                     462) omit the period after \"louse\". Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52)\n                     read the deleted word at the end of the line, which begins with a legible \"cl\"\n                     and has been both struck through and erased, as \"climing\" (that is,\n                     climbing). Phillips reads a period\n                     after the comma (page 52). Bentley reads \"slides\"\n                     instead of \"sliders\" (Writings volume 2, page 894). Erdman reads a period after the dash (page 462). Erdman reads the deleted \"he\" after \"room.\", less probably, as \"Go\" (page\n                     462). Bentley reads the deletions that begin at the end of line 1 as \"you are\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 895), Erdman as \"you / ar\" (page\n                     462), Phillips as \"gas / --\" (page 55). Beyond the descender on the first word,\n                     the deletions are illegible and the readings speculative. This is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched with\n                     designs, became \"Holy Thursday\" in Songs of Innocence, 1789\n                     (Bentley plate 19). For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 18-20. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     93-94n). This line was probably written in the break between the original stanzas 2\n                     and 3 as a replacement for the final line of stanza 2 (line 21) after Blake had\n                     deleted it. A four-line stanza (lines 23-26) has been\n                     deleted. After it was deleted, the second couplet (lines 25-26) was not reused;\n                     the first couplet (lines 23-24) was rewritten and used to introduce the revised\n                     stanza below (lines 27-30). This unrhymed line is unique in a poem otherwise\n                     written in couplets. Erdman reads \"Cherubim & Seraphim\" (page 850n). Lines 28-31 make up the revised stanza that\n                     replaces the deleted four-line stanza (lines 23-26) and the unrhymed verse that\n                     follows (line 27). A second lowercase \"g\" is written over the original \"g\" in \"among\", perhaps\n                     to strengthen it.  Bentley reads the deletion as \"Mrs Sistagatist\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 896). Bentley reads the deletion as \"Grand\" (Writings volume 2, page 896). \"The voice\" is washed out. These lines\n                     (35-44) make up the opening two stanzas of the earliest known draft of the poem\n                     that, etched with designs, became \"Nurse's Song\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 24). The poem continues on the next page\n                     of the manuscript. For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 94-95n. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     94-95n). The spacing and\n                     lettering suggest that the line originally began \"The tongues\". Blake then\n                     inserted \"When\" before \"The\" and altered \"The\" to \"the\" to read \"When the\n                     tongues\". These two stanzas (lines 1-11) complete the draft of \"Nurse's Song\"\n                     that begins on the previous page (14.35-44). Erdman outlines the sequence of revisions thus: Blake originally wrote\n                     \"cannot go to sleep\", emended it to \"cannot sleep till its dark\", and then\n                     restored the original \"cannot go to sleep\" (page 850n). Phillips describes a\n                     similar sequence, but notes that the original \"go to\" was overwritten by \"get\n                     to\" and \"till its dark\" was added to the line (to read \"and we cannot get to\n                     sleep till its dark\"). Phillips claims that Blake then restored the original\n                     \"go to\" by a supralinear insertion and deleted \"till its dark\" (page 95n). See\n                     note for line 4 for additional information about Blake's revisions to these\n                     lines. Phillips gives a plausible account of the revisions in lines 2-4 that hinges\n                     on the notion that Blake, \"momentarily forgetting the rhyme scheme [abcb]\n                     established in the first stanzas on the preceding page\", wrote line 4, made\n                     some adjustments in lines 2-3, and then recognizing \"his mistake ... restored\n                     the original reading\" of line 3, deleted line 4, and then \"went on to write the\n                     next two lines\" in conformity with the original rhyme scheme (page 95n). Erdman reads a lowercase initial \"s\" in the undeleted \"Sung Quid\" at the end\n                     of the line (page 463). This (lines 13-20) is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched\n                     with designs, became \"The Little Boy lost\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 13). Phillips prints a version of the\n                     poem that displays the differences between this and the etched version (page\n                     96). The word \"turd\" is deleted and replaced by \"tansey\", written in\n                     lighter ink. Erdman reads the beginning of the deletion as \"To hit me\" (page\n                     850n). Erdman reads \"a[ny bird the\"\n                     (page 850n); Bentley \"[\u00e2\u0080\u0083 \u00e2\u0080\u0083d he del]\" (Writings volume 2, page 897); Phillips \"an old\n                        he (page 56). Phillips reads \"began-\" (page 56). The phrase \"leave to\" is presumably a slip for\n                     \"leave me to\". \"O\" is written over \"l\" (probably the start of \"leave\",\n                     conjectures Erdman, page 850n). Two lines (15-16) have been deleted, leaving them only partly legible. They\n                     may read (with Erdman page 850n), \"How many Blackamoors / Coud sing with their\n                     thick lips\". Blake may have originally started line 15 with \"If\" before\n                     changing to \"How\" (Erdman page 850n). Bentley reads line 15 less confidently:\n                        \"If(?) we(?) manage(?)\n                     Blackamoors\" (Writings volume 2, page 898). And there is\n                     considerable uncertainty in the reading of the first word of line 16, which may\n                     be \"Will\" (Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 898), \"Coud\"\n                     (Erdman page 850n), or \"cant\" (Phillips page 59). Bentley reads the opening word of the line as \"thus\" (Writings volume 2, page 899). Phillips reads the deleted word(s) following \"other\" as \"sheet a\" (page 60).\n                     Bentley notes only \"word del\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 899), while Erdman does not note the deletion. Bentley reads \"Sicknackers\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899), Phillips \"Sicknakers\" (page 60). Between \"people\" and \"who\" is a stroke \u00e2\u0080\u0094 probably a false start\n                     \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that Phillips reads as a short dash (page 60). \"abilies\": i.e., presumably, a slip for \"abilities\".\n                     Bentley reads \"abilies\" as \"abities\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899).  \"yo\": i.e.,\n                     presumably, a slip for \"you\". The illegible letters and \"William Blake\" have been\n                  smudged. All of the text in this line has\n                     been smudged. The \"N\" has been\n                     smudged. The gap indicates a partial letter. It may be the backstroke for a capital\n                     letter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 perhaps \"B\". At the beginning of the line\n                     are two partial letters. The first may be a partial capital \"T\" or \"F\". The\n                     second is a small partial stroke. The second legible \"n\" has been\n                     smudged. The text has been smudged. The \"m\" has been smudged. The words \"William Blake\" appear to\n                     have been cancelled.  \"Lamb\", written in a very small hand, is\n                     almost obscured by the first large \"n\". The second \"n\" has been lightly\n                     smudged. The illegible text at the end of the line appears to be a partial\n                     letter\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps \"c\" or \"o\". The illegible text could be the capital letter \"L\" or simply a\n                     squiggle. The letters \"Bl\" (followed by an uncertain letter \"a\") are written in\n                     backwards lettering. They are also smudged. The\n                     text has been smudged, and is written vertically in the lower right quadrant of\n                     the page. The blank verso of this leaf, designated as page B in Bentley and showing a\n                  considerable amount of show-through of the writing on this recto, is not\n                  reproduced here. Two or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time\n                  prior to 1905, between leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). Refer to\n                  the Work Information for more details about the manuscript. A diagonal pencil\n                  inscription at the bottom of the page, not in Blake's hand, reads, \"a leaf is\n                  evidently missing before this one\". At least some of the sketches and lettering on the verso (reproduced here) may\n                  conceivably be the product of both William Blake and his youngest brother Robert\n                  (1762-87). The awkwardness and redundancy of some of the work, the bare geometry\n                  of the head of the large lion(?) in the lower pair of animals in the upper left\n                  quadrant of the page, and the heavy overdrawing on some of the other animals are\n                  among the features that may possibly reflect Robert's attempts to draw subjects\n                  that had been set as exercises for him by older brother William, and, in some\n                  instances, corrected by one of them.The blank recto, designated as page O in Bentley, and showing a considerable\n                  amount of show-through from the ink lines on this verso, is not reproduced\n                  here.",

        "notes": "Bentley designates these as pages 1-16, A, P. Not included here,\n                  among the 18 objects, are the blank verso of object 17 (Bentley page B) and the\n                  blank recto of object 18 (Bentley page O). We are also not including Bentley pages\n                  C-N, all blanks, which are now housed separately from the leaves bearing the\n                  manuscript. Each leaf was originally half of a folio (2 conjugate leaves). Two\n                  or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time prior to 1905, between\n                  leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). The verso of leaf 9 (page B in\n                  Bentley) and the recto of what is now leaf 10 (formerly leaf 16, page O in\n                  Bentley) are blank. These blank pages are not reproduced here. Before rebinding in\n                  1978, there were 6 blank leaves (Bentley pages C-N) of the same paper that bears\n                  the manuscript between what are now leaves 9 and 10 (objects 17-18 as numbered\n                  here). As the sequence of watermarks and countermarks indicates, these blank\n                  leaves were once conjugate with the manuscript. The verso of the final leaf\n                  (object 18 as numbered here and page P in Bentley) bears assorted drawings and\n                  inscriptions. It is included in Butlin's catalogue (no. 149) as \"The Lamb Lying\n                  Down with the Lion and Other Drawings, from 'An Island in the Moon' Manuscript.\"\n                      The watermark appears on leaves 2-8, 10 (objects 3-16, 18 as numbered\n                  here). A countermark, consisting of the letters \"G R\" under a crown, appears on\n                  leaves 1 and 9 (objects 1-2, 17 as numbered here). Object 3 is numbered both 1 and 2 upper left and 5 upper right;\n                  object 5 is numbered 3 upper left and 6 upper right. Objects 7, 11, 13, and 15 are\n                  numbered 9, 6, 7, and 8 upper left. All these numbers are in pencil. They are\n                  probably not written by Blake and thus are not included in our\n                  transcriptions. Each manuscript leaf is mounted\n                  in a paper frame. The present binding was created in 1978; formerly bound in red\n                  morocco with each leaf attached to a stub. The former binding included a\n                  proofsheet of Blake's woodcuts for Robert John Thornton's Pastorals\n                     of Virgil (1821) and a note from A.H. Palmer referring to their\n                  provenance.  Early history not known. Acquired before 1893 by Charles Fairfax Murray; given by\n               Murray to the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1905. A Fitzwilliam Museum collection stamp\n               appears on the verso of the final leaf (object 18 here). Erdman reads the deletion as \"tipsy\" (page 449), Bentley as illegible\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 875), and Phillips as \"tipsy\n                     &\" (page 28). Blake may have first written \"endeavourd\" or \"endeavoured\" before altering\n                     the word to \"endeavouring\". Erdman (page 449) and Phillips (page 28) read \"imagination\" as\n                     \"imaginations\".  Various attempts have been made to\n                     decipher the illegible deletions in lines 24-25. The deletion in line 24\n                     appears to have been an inserted addition following \"Philosophers\" in line 25.\n                     Bentley reads the deletion as \"Quid\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876); Phillips as \"the older\" (page 28); Erdman as \"Quid\" (deleted), replaced\n                     by \"the Older\", mended to \"the Elder\", deleted in turn (pages 450,\n                     849n). \"Inffammable\": i.e., \"Inflammable\" (corrected by Blake,\n                     according to Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 876). In line 32,\n                     the letters \"ee\" in \"see\" appear to have been struck through. A word in line 35, presumably intended for \"Antiquarian\", is\n                     partly covered by an ink spot. A word in line 36, presumably intended for\n                     \"along\", is partly covered by an ink spot. Phillips (page 28) and Erdman (page 450) read\n                     \"outr\u00c3\u00a9\", Bentley \"outr\u00c3\u00a8\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876).  In line 2, the deleted words are probably\n                     \"here the\" (Phillips page 31) preceded by a partially deleted em-dash, but\n                     Bentley reads the deletions as \"----- had the\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 876), Erdman as \"here Etr\" (page 450). In line 4, part of the the \"I\" in \"Inflammable\" has been cut\n                     away. Erdman emends \"staring\" to\n                     \"star[t]ing\" (page 450). \"Obuse\":\n                     i.e., presumably, \"Obtuse\". Erdman (mistakenly) reads an inserted \"said\" just after the deletion\n                     (page 450). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878) and Phillips (page\n                     32) read the deletion as \"and\"; Erdman (page 451) reads it as \"Miss\". Our\n                     reading of \"and\" is uncertain. Phillips reads \"Ma\" instead of \"M.rs\n                     Sigtagatist\" (32). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" instead of \"Sigtagatist\"\n                     throughout (Writings volume 2), but, as Erdman indicates,\n                     \"The name 'Sigtagatist' was first written 'Sistagatist' in most places, but\n                     mended\" (page 849n). In lines 3-7, it is possible that the women's names\n                     replace the deleted men's names, but this substitution is uncertain. Deleted at the end of the line is a phrase, \"All the three Philosophers\",\n                     followed by words that Bentley finds illegible (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878), Phillips reads as \"& very\" (page 32), and Erdman as\n                     \"and the three Philosophers com[in]g\" (page 849n). Our reading of these words\n                     (\"& very\") is uncertain.  In the deletion, Erdman reads \"& Suction\" (page 849n). In the deletion, Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878)\n                     and Erdman (page 849n) omit the \"&\". \"Gibble Gabble the wife of Inflammable\n                     Gass __\" may be part of a larger replacement of women's names for the deleted\n                     men's names in lines 4-6. In the deletion, Phillips omits the \"&\" after \"room\"\n                     (page 32). \"Little Scopprell ... the room\" may be part of a larger replacement\n                     of women's names for the deleted men's names in lines 4-6. \"*Arse\" apparently replaced the deleted\n                     \"Ass\" before both words were deleted and replaced by \"ass_\" (added in light\n                     ink). Erdman, on the basis of the asterisk, restores \"Arse\", to read the line\n                     as \"call me *Arse--)\" (pages 451, 849n). The deletion \"an\" is not noted by Bentley and Erdman. Bentley reads \"would\" as \"wants\" (Writings volume\n                     2, page 878). Bentley reads \"laught\" as \"laughd\" (Writings volume 2, page 878). Bentley reads the\n                     deleted word as \"Comparative(?)\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878). For \"answerd\" (line 31), Erdman reads\n                     \"?exclaimed\" (page 849n). Phillips reads the illegible deletion as \"Miss\"\n                     (page 32); Erdman describes it as a \"short illegible word ending in 'f'\" (page\n                     849n). Phillips reads the deleted phrase (in lines 39-40) as \"of / what you\n                     read\" (page 32), while Erdman reads \"of / what you st\" (page 452). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page 879) throughout. Blake has inserted a\n                     curly bracket that spans lines 10-11. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 880) throughout. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     880) throughout. Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and\n                     Erdman (page 453) read \"Mathematician\". \"why / I know that\" (spanning lines 16, 18) is deleted and then restored (in\n                     line 17) above the deletion and the underscore in line 18. Erdman reads the\n                     deletion as \"?obj Obtuse ?Angle\" (page 849n). The word \"whether\" may be \"whither\". Bentley reads the deletion (lines 31-32) as \"what is this gim(?) used for\" (Writings volume 2, page 849n). For\n                     \"Arsdology\" Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and Erdman\n                     (page 453) read \"Aridology\". Bentley reads \"Hagamy Hatomy\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 881). Erdman reads the deletion as \"Cha\" (page 451) and\n                     Phillips as \"the\" (page 36). Phillips reads the deletion as\n                     \"tw--\" (page 39) and Erdman as \"twen[ty]\" (page 454). Phillips reads the deletion as \"a-\" (page 39). There is a redundant stroke in the first \"p\" of\n                     \"Sipsop\". The deletion (\"bl\") is not noted by Bentley and\n                     Erdman. The heavily deleted words at the end of the line are illegible except for\n                     \"This is\" at the beginning and a lowercase \"f\" midway. Bentley ventures to\n                     decipher \"This is\" (Writings volume 2, page 885); Erdman,\n                     more aggressively, ventures \"This is unfair and ?I ?think\" (page 456). The ink used to delete this line is lighter than the original ink. The illegible deletion is not noted by Erdman. The last word of the line is\n                     \"as\", though Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 885) and Erdman\n                     (page 456) read \"a\" without comment. \"Sopprell\": i.e., presumably, a slip for\n                     \"Scopprell\". \"Gent\" is written over an obscured word\n                     ending in \"man\", deleted by wash. Erdman (page 848) and Phillips (page 43) read\n                     the deleted word at the end of the line as \"Gentleman\". The word \"about\" (an uncertain reading)\n                     is written over text that cannot be recovered. Bentley makes out \"three words del\" (Writings volume 2, page 886),\n                     while Erdman reads \"its a book about\" (page 456). Phillips renders the phrase\n                     as we do here, though he speculates further that the \"first reading may have\n                     been 'Steelyard then' written in light brown ink, evidently the same ink used\n                     to write the first reading 'Gentleman' immediately above. 'Steelyard then' was\n                     then deleted with a full nib in a series of flourishes ending in 'about'\" (page\n                     83n). With this line, Blake shifts to using a lighter\n                     ink. Bentley\n                     reads \"coach\" (Writings volume 2, page 886) instead of\n                     \"coaches\". Phillips reads the final word as \"ride\" but indicates that this reading is\n                     \"conjectured\" (pages 44, 84). Erdman and Bentley see only a three-word\n                     deletion: \"he does not\". Erdman omits the initial ampersand altogether (page\n                     457). Bentley leaves it standing, undeleted (Writings volume\n                     2, page 887). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 887) and Erdman (page 457) both read the last\n                     word of the deletion as \"Envying\". \"kins\" in \"lambkins\" is written over \"s\n                     do\" in \"lambs do\". Bentley reads \"that\" for \"That\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     888). For \"pritty\" Bentley reads \"pretty\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 889). In lines 29 and 31, \"about London / O no\" is legible but deleted \"by\n                     washing out\" (Phillips page 88n). Phillips reads this line\n                     as \"My\", \"written in very pale brown ink\", above \"Nannicantipot\" (pages 47,\n                     88n). But it seems rather to be \"tty\", mirroring the letters just above, in\n                     \"pritty\", and partly erased. In line 31, \"about Matches\" could be replacing the\n                     deleted \"O no\" in the same line and/or the deleted \"about London\" in line\n                     29. \"When\" is washed out but clearly legible above \"Then\", which replaces\n                     it. Erdman reads\n                     the deleted \"sweet\" as \"sweeter\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"?one\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"ll\" (page\n                     459); Bentley does not note the deletion. An erased \"f\", clearly visible before\n                     \"cock\", is the most visible remains of what may be \"This frog\", which was\n                     erased and overwritten with \"Sing co\" in \"Sing cock\" (Erdman page 849n,\n                     Phillips page 90n). The descender of a corrected \"p\" remains\n                     in the middle of \"Sipsop\". Bentley reads \"Sung\" for \"sung\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 891). An illegible\n                     letter or other mark may be deleted between \"Hail\" and \"fingerfooted\". Phillips\n                     reads this as an (undeleted) short dash, \"Hail - fingerfooted\" (page 48).\n                     Bentley and Erdman do not note it. Bentley reads \"widow\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"maidens\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"matrimony\" for \"Matrimony\" and \"how\" for \"How\" (Writings volume 2, page 892).  Erdman reads \"Cynic\" for \"cynic\" (page 460). For \"allways,\" Erdman (page 460) and Phillips (page 51) read\n                     \"always\". The word \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40). In the next line, the letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" are\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41), thus reversing the original order of those\n                     words.  The letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" is\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41). In the previous line, \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40), thus reversing the original order of those\n                  words. The \"s\" at\n                     the end of \"laws\" is made unclear by what may be a spot of ink. Erdman maintains that \"jet\" is \"mended from git\"\n                     (page 850n; also Phillips page 92n). Bentley reads \"give\" for \"gave\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 894). The horizontal line terminates in an area of wash. Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52) read\n                     \"foolish.--\". Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 894) and Erdman (page\n                     462) omit the period after \"louse\". Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52)\n                     read the deleted word at the end of the line, which begins with a legible \"cl\"\n                     and has been both struck through and erased, as \"climing\" (that is,\n                     climbing). Phillips reads a period\n                     after the comma (page 52). Bentley reads \"slides\"\n                     instead of \"sliders\" (Writings volume 2, page 894). Erdman reads a period after the dash (page 462). Erdman reads the deleted \"he\" after \"room.\", less probably, as \"Go\" (page\n                     462). Bentley reads the deletions that begin at the end of line 1 as \"you are\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 895), Erdman as \"you / ar\" (page\n                     462), Phillips as \"gas / --\" (page 55). Beyond the descender on the first word,\n                     the deletions are illegible and the readings speculative. This is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched with\n                     designs, became \"Holy Thursday\" in Songs of Innocence, 1789\n                     (Bentley plate 19). For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 18-20. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     93-94n). This line was probably written in the break between the original stanzas 2\n                     and 3 as a replacement for the final line of stanza 2 (line 21) after Blake had\n                     deleted it. A four-line stanza (lines 23-26) has been\n                     deleted. After it was deleted, the second couplet (lines 25-26) was not reused;\n                     the first couplet (lines 23-24) was rewritten and used to introduce the revised\n                     stanza below (lines 27-30). This unrhymed line is unique in a poem otherwise\n                     written in couplets. Erdman reads \"Cherubim & Seraphim\" (page 850n). Lines 28-31 make up the revised stanza that\n                     replaces the deleted four-line stanza (lines 23-26) and the unrhymed verse that\n                     follows (line 27). A second lowercase \"g\" is written over the original \"g\" in \"among\", perhaps\n                     to strengthen it.  Bentley reads the deletion as \"Mrs Sistagatist\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 896). Bentley reads the deletion as \"Grand\" (Writings volume 2, page 896). \"The voice\" is washed out. These lines\n                     (35-44) make up the opening two stanzas of the earliest known draft of the poem\n                     that, etched with designs, became \"Nurse's Song\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 24). The poem continues on the next page\n                     of the manuscript. For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 94-95n. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     94-95n). The spacing and\n                     lettering suggest that the line originally began \"The tongues\". Blake then\n                     inserted \"When\" before \"The\" and altered \"The\" to \"the\" to read \"When the\n                     tongues\". These two stanzas (lines 1-11) complete the draft of \"Nurse's Song\"\n                     that begins on the previous page (14.35-44). Erdman outlines the sequence of revisions thus: Blake originally wrote\n                     \"cannot go to sleep\", emended it to \"cannot sleep till its dark\", and then\n                     restored the original \"cannot go to sleep\" (page 850n). Phillips describes a\n                     similar sequence, but notes that the original \"go to\" was overwritten by \"get\n                     to\" and \"till its dark\" was added to the line (to read \"and we cannot get to\n                     sleep till its dark\"). Phillips claims that Blake then restored the original\n                     \"go to\" by a supralinear insertion and deleted \"till its dark\" (page 95n). See\n                     note for line 4 for additional information about Blake's revisions to these\n                     lines. Phillips gives a plausible account of the revisions in lines 2-4 that hinges\n                     on the notion that Blake, \"momentarily forgetting the rhyme scheme [abcb]\n                     established in the first stanzas on the preceding page\", wrote line 4, made\n                     some adjustments in lines 2-3, and then recognizing \"his mistake ... restored\n                     the original reading\" of line 3, deleted line 4, and then \"went on to write the\n                     next two lines\" in conformity with the original rhyme scheme (page 95n). Erdman reads a lowercase initial \"s\" in the undeleted \"Sung Quid\" at the end\n                     of the line (page 463). This (lines 13-20) is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched\n                     with designs, became \"The Little Boy lost\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 13). Phillips prints a version of the\n                     poem that displays the differences between this and the etched version (page\n                     96). The word \"turd\" is deleted and replaced by \"tansey\", written in\n                     lighter ink. Erdman reads the beginning of the deletion as \"To hit me\" (page\n                     850n). Erdman reads \"a[ny bird the\"\n                     (page 850n); Bentley \"[\u00e2\u0080\u0083 \u00e2\u0080\u0083d he del]\" (Writings volume 2, page 897); Phillips \"an old\n                        he (page 56). Phillips reads \"began-\" (page 56). The phrase \"leave to\" is presumably a slip for\n                     \"leave me to\". \"O\" is written over \"l\" (probably the start of \"leave\",\n                     conjectures Erdman, page 850n). Two lines (15-16) have been deleted, leaving them only partly legible. They\n                     may read (with Erdman page 850n), \"How many Blackamoors / Coud sing with their\n                     thick lips\". Blake may have originally started line 15 with \"If\" before\n                     changing to \"How\" (Erdman page 850n). Bentley reads line 15 less confidently:\n                        \"If(?) we(?) manage(?)\n                     Blackamoors\" (Writings volume 2, page 898). And there is\n                     considerable uncertainty in the reading of the first word of line 16, which may\n                     be \"Will\" (Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 898), \"Coud\"\n                     (Erdman page 850n), or \"cant\" (Phillips page 59). Bentley reads the opening word of the line as \"thus\" (Writings volume 2, page 899). Phillips reads the deleted word(s) following \"other\" as \"sheet a\" (page 60).\n                     Bentley notes only \"word del\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 899), while Erdman does not note the deletion. Bentley reads \"Sicknackers\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899), Phillips \"Sicknakers\" (page 60). Between \"people\" and \"who\" is a stroke \u00e2\u0080\u0094 probably a false start\n                     \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that Phillips reads as a short dash (page 60). \"abilies\": i.e., presumably, a slip for \"abilities\".\n                     Bentley reads \"abilies\" as \"abities\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899).  \"yo\": i.e.,\n                     presumably, a slip for \"you\". The illegible letters and \"William Blake\" have been\n                  smudged. All of the text in this line has\n                     been smudged. The \"N\" has been\n                     smudged. The gap indicates a partial letter. It may be the backstroke for a capital\n                     letter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 perhaps \"B\". At the beginning of the line\n                     are two partial letters. The first may be a partial capital \"T\" or \"F\". The\n                     second is a small partial stroke. The second legible \"n\" has been\n                     smudged. The text has been smudged. The \"m\" has been smudged. The words \"William Blake\" appear to\n                     have been cancelled.  \"Lamb\", written in a very small hand, is\n                     almost obscured by the first large \"n\". The second \"n\" has been lightly\n                     smudged. The illegible text at the end of the line appears to be a partial\n                     letter\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps \"c\" or \"o\". The illegible text could be the capital letter \"L\" or simply a\n                     squiggle. The letters \"Bl\" (followed by an uncertain letter \"a\") are written in\n                     backwards lettering. They are also smudged. The\n                     text has been smudged, and is written vertically in the lower right quadrant of\n                     the page. The blank verso of this leaf, designated as page B in Bentley and showing a\n                  considerable amount of show-through of the writing on this recto, is not\n                  reproduced here. Two or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time\n                  prior to 1905, between leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). Refer to\n                  the Work Information for more details about the manuscript. A diagonal pencil\n                  inscription at the bottom of the page, not in Blake's hand, reads, \"a leaf is\n                  evidently missing before this one\". At least some of the sketches and lettering on the verso (reproduced here) may\n                  conceivably be the product of both William Blake and his youngest brother Robert\n                  (1762-87). The awkwardness and redundancy of some of the work, the bare geometry\n                  of the head of the large lion(?) in the lower pair of animals in the upper left\n                  quadrant of the page, and the heavy overdrawing on some of the other animals are\n                  among the features that may possibly reflect Robert's attempts to draw subjects\n                  that had been set as exercises for him by older brother William, and, in some\n                  instances, corrected by one of them.The blank recto, designated as page O in Bentley, and showing a considerable\n                  amount of show-through from the ink lines on this verso, is not reproduced\n                  here.",

Not included here,\n                  among the 18 objects, are the blank verso of object 17 (Bentley page B) and the\n                  blank recto of object 18 (Bentley page O). We are also not including Bentley pages\n                  C-N, all blanks, which are now housed separately from the leaves bearing the\n                  manuscript. Each leaf was originally half of a folio (2 conjugate leaves). Two\n                  or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time prior to 1905, between\n                  leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). The verso of leaf 9 (page B in\n                  Bentley) and the recto of what is now leaf 10 (formerly leaf 16, page O in\n                  Bentley) are blank. These blank pages are not reproduced here. Before rebinding in\n                  1978, there were 6 blank leaves (Bentley pages C-N) of the same paper that bears\n                  the manuscript between what are now leaves 9 and 10 (objects 17-18 as numbered\n                  here). As the sequence of watermarks and countermarks indicates, these blank\n                  leaves were once conjugate with the manuscript. The verso of the final leaf\n                  (object 18 as numbered here and page P in Bentley) bears assorted drawings and\n                  inscriptions. It is included in Butlin's catalogue (no. 149) as \"The Lamb Lying\n                  Down with the Lion and Other Drawings, from 'An Island in the Moon' Manuscript.\"\n                      The watermark appears on leaves 2-8, 10 (objects 3-16, 18 as numbered\n                  here). A countermark, consisting of the letters \"G R\" under a crown, appears on\n                  leaves 1 and 9 (objects 1-2, 17 as numbered here). Object 3 is numbered both 1 and 2 upper left and 5 upper right;\n                  object 5 is numbered 3 upper left and 6 upper right. Objects 7, 11, 13, and 15 are\n                  numbered 9, 6, 7, and 8 upper left. All these numbers are in pencil. They are\n                  probably not written by Blake and thus are not included in our\n                  transcriptions. Each manuscript leaf is mounted\n                  in a paper frame. The present binding was created in 1978; formerly bound in red\n                  morocco with each leaf attached to a stub. The former binding included a\n                  proofsheet of Blake's woodcuts for Robert John Thornton's Pastorals\n                     of Virgil (1821) and a note from A.H. Palmer referring to their\n                  provenance.  Early history not known. Acquired before 1893 by Charles Fairfax Murray; given by\n               Murray to the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1905. A Fitzwilliam Museum collection stamp\n               appears on the verso of the final leaf (object 18 here). Erdman reads the deletion as \"tipsy\" (page 449), Bentley as illegible\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 875), and Phillips as \"tipsy\n                     &\" (page 28). Blake may have first written \"endeavourd\" or \"endeavoured\" before altering\n                     the word to \"endeavouring\". Erdman (page 449) and Phillips (page 28) read \"imagination\" as\n                     \"imaginations\".  Various attempts have been made to\n                     decipher the illegible deletions in lines 24-25. The deletion in line 24\n                     appears to have been an inserted addition following \"Philosophers\" in line 25.\n                     Bentley reads the deletion as \"Quid\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876); Phillips as \"the older\" (page 28); Erdman as \"Quid\" (deleted), replaced\n                     by \"the Older\", mended to \"the Elder\", deleted in turn (pages 450,\n                     849n). \"Inffammable\": i.e., \"Inflammable\" (corrected by Blake,\n                     according to Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 876). In line 32,\n                     the letters \"ee\" in \"see\" appear to have been struck through. A word in line 35, presumably intended for \"Antiquarian\", is\n                     partly covered by an ink spot. A word in line 36, presumably intended for\n                     \"along\", is partly covered by an ink spot. Phillips (page 28) and Erdman (page 450) read\n                     \"outr\u00c3\u00a9\", Bentley \"outr\u00c3\u00a8\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876).  In line 2, the deleted words are probably\n                     \"here the\" (Phillips page 31) preceded by a partially deleted em-dash, but\n                     Bentley reads the deletions as \"----- had the\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 876), Erdman as \"here Etr\" (page 450). In line 4, part of the the \"I\" in \"Inflammable\" has been cut\n                     away. Erdman emends \"staring\" to\n                     \"star[t]ing\" (page 450). \"Obuse\":\n                     i.e., presumably, \"Obtuse\". Erdman (mistakenly) reads an inserted \"said\" just after the deletion\n                     (page 450). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878) and Phillips (page\n                     32) read the deletion as \"and\"; Erdman (page 451) reads it as \"Miss\". Our\n                     reading of \"and\" is uncertain. Phillips reads \"Ma\" instead of \"M.rs\n                     Sigtagatist\" (32). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" instead of \"Sigtagatist\"\n                     throughout (Writings volume 2), but, as Erdman indicates,\n                     \"The name 'Sigtagatist' was first written 'Sistagatist' in most places, but\n                     mended\" (page 849n). In lines 3-7, it is possible that the women's names\n                     replace the deleted men's names, but this substitution is uncertain. Deleted at the end of the line is a phrase, \"All the three Philosophers\",\n                     followed by words that Bentley finds illegible (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878), Phillips reads as \"& very\" (page 32), and Erdman as\n                     \"and the three Philosophers com[in]g\" (page 849n). Our reading of these words\n                     (\"& very\") is uncertain.  In the deletion, Erdman reads \"& Suction\" (page 849n). In the deletion, Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878)\n                     and Erdman (page 849n) omit the \"&\". \"Gibble Gabble the wife of Inflammable\n                     Gass __\" may be part of a larger replacement of women's names for the deleted\n                     men's names in lines 4-6. In the deletion, Phillips omits the \"&\" after \"room\"\n                     (page 32). \"Little Scopprell ... the room\" may be part of a larger replacement\n                     of women's names for the deleted men's names in lines 4-6. \"*Arse\" apparently replaced the deleted\n                     \"Ass\" before both words were deleted and replaced by \"ass_\" (added in light\n                     ink). Erdman, on the basis of the asterisk, restores \"Arse\", to read the line\n                     as \"call me *Arse--)\" (pages 451, 849n). The deletion \"an\" is not noted by Bentley and Erdman. Bentley reads \"would\" as \"wants\" (Writings volume\n                     2, page 878). Bentley reads \"laught\" as \"laughd\" (Writings volume 2, page 878). Bentley reads the\n                     deleted word as \"Comparative(?)\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878). For \"answerd\" (line 31), Erdman reads\n                     \"?exclaimed\" (page 849n). Phillips reads the illegible deletion as \"Miss\"\n                     (page 32); Erdman describes it as a \"short illegible word ending in 'f'\" (page\n                     849n). Phillips reads the deleted phrase (in lines 39-40) as \"of / what you\n                     read\" (page 32), while Erdman reads \"of / what you st\" (page 452). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page 879) throughout. Blake has inserted a\n                     curly bracket that spans lines 10-11. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 880) throughout. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     880) throughout. Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and\n                     Erdman (page 453) read \"Mathematician\". \"why / I know that\" (spanning lines 16, 18) is deleted and then restored (in\n                     line 17) above the deletion and the underscore in line 18. Erdman reads the\n                     deletion as \"?obj Obtuse ?Angle\" (page 849n). The word \"whether\" may be \"whither\". Bentley reads the deletion (lines 31-32) as \"what is this gim(?) used for\" (Writings volume 2, page 849n). For\n                     \"Arsdology\" Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and Erdman\n                     (page 453) read \"Aridology\". Bentley reads \"Hagamy Hatomy\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 881). Erdman reads the deletion as \"Cha\" (page 451) and\n                     Phillips as \"the\" (page 36). Phillips reads the deletion as\n                     \"tw--\" (page 39) and Erdman as \"twen[ty]\" (page 454). Phillips reads the deletion as \"a-\" (page 39). There is a redundant stroke in the first \"p\" of\n                     \"Sipsop\". The deletion (\"bl\") is not noted by Bentley and\n                     Erdman. The heavily deleted words at the end of the line are illegible except for\n                     \"This is\" at the beginning and a lowercase \"f\" midway. Bentley ventures to\n                     decipher \"This is\" (Writings volume 2, page 885); Erdman,\n                     more aggressively, ventures \"This is unfair and ?I ?think\" (page 456). The ink used to delete this line is lighter than the original ink. The illegible deletion is not noted by Erdman. The last word of the line is\n                     \"as\", though Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 885) and Erdman\n                     (page 456) read \"a\" without comment. \"Sopprell\": i.e., presumably, a slip for\n                     \"Scopprell\". \"Gent\" is written over an obscured word\n                     ending in \"man\", deleted by wash. Erdman (page 848) and Phillips (page 43) read\n                     the deleted word at the end of the line as \"Gentleman\". The word \"about\" (an uncertain reading)\n                     is written over text that cannot be recovered. Bentley makes out \"three words del\" (Writings volume 2, page 886),\n                     while Erdman reads \"its a book about\" (page 456). Phillips renders the phrase\n                     as we do here, though he speculates further that the \"first reading may have\n                     been 'Steelyard then' written in light brown ink, evidently the same ink used\n                     to write the first reading 'Gentleman' immediately above. 'Steelyard then' was\n                     then deleted with a full nib in a series of flourishes ending in 'about'\" (page\n                     83n). With this line, Blake shifts to using a lighter\n                     ink. Bentley\n                     reads \"coach\" (Writings volume 2, page 886) instead of\n                     \"coaches\". Phillips reads the final word as \"ride\" but indicates that this reading is\n                     \"conjectured\" (pages 44, 84). Erdman and Bentley see only a three-word\n                     deletion: \"he does not\". Erdman omits the initial ampersand altogether (page\n                     457). Bentley leaves it standing, undeleted (Writings volume\n                     2, page 887). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 887) and Erdman (page 457) both read the last\n                     word of the deletion as \"Envying\". \"kins\" in \"lambkins\" is written over \"s\n                     do\" in \"lambs do\". Bentley reads \"that\" for \"That\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     888). For \"pritty\" Bentley reads \"pretty\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 889). In lines 29 and 31, \"about London / O no\" is legible but deleted \"by\n                     washing out\" (Phillips page 88n). Phillips reads this line\n                     as \"My\", \"written in very pale brown ink\", above \"Nannicantipot\" (pages 47,\n                     88n). But it seems rather to be \"tty\", mirroring the letters just above, in\n                     \"pritty\", and partly erased. In line 31, \"about Matches\" could be replacing the\n                     deleted \"O no\" in the same line and/or the deleted \"about London\" in line\n                     29. \"When\" is washed out but clearly legible above \"Then\", which replaces\n                     it. Erdman reads\n                     the deleted \"sweet\" as \"sweeter\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"?one\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"ll\" (page\n                     459); Bentley does not note the deletion. An erased \"f\", clearly visible before\n                     \"cock\", is the most visible remains of what may be \"This frog\", which was\n                     erased and overwritten with \"Sing co\" in \"Sing cock\" (Erdman page 849n,\n                     Phillips page 90n). The descender of a corrected \"p\" remains\n                     in the middle of \"Sipsop\". Bentley reads \"Sung\" for \"sung\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 891). An illegible\n                     letter or other mark may be deleted between \"Hail\" and \"fingerfooted\". Phillips\n                     reads this as an (undeleted) short dash, \"Hail - fingerfooted\" (page 48).\n                     Bentley and Erdman do not note it. Bentley reads \"widow\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"maidens\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"matrimony\" for \"Matrimony\" and \"how\" for \"How\" (Writings volume 2, page 892).  Erdman reads \"Cynic\" for \"cynic\" (page 460). For \"allways,\" Erdman (page 460) and Phillips (page 51) read\n                     \"always\". The word \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40). In the next line, the letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" are\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41), thus reversing the original order of those\n                     words.  The letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" is\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41). In the previous line, \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40), thus reversing the original order of those\n                  words. The \"s\" at\n                     the end of \"laws\" is made unclear by what may be a spot of ink. Erdman maintains that \"jet\" is \"mended from git\"\n                     (page 850n; also Phillips page 92n). Bentley reads \"give\" for \"gave\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 894). The horizontal line terminates in an area of wash. Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52) read\n                     \"foolish.--\". Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 894) and Erdman (page\n                     462) omit the period after \"louse\". Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52)\n                     read the deleted word at the end of the line, which begins with a legible \"cl\"\n                     and has been both struck through and erased, as \"climing\" (that is,\n                     climbing). Phillips reads a period\n                     after the comma (page 52). Bentley reads \"slides\"\n                     instead of \"sliders\" (Writings volume 2, page 894). Erdman reads a period after the dash (page 462). Erdman reads the deleted \"he\" after \"room.\", less probably, as \"Go\" (page\n                     462). Bentley reads the deletions that begin at the end of line 1 as \"you are\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 895), Erdman as \"you / ar\" (page\n                     462), Phillips as \"gas / --\" (page 55). Beyond the descender on the first word,\n                     the deletions are illegible and the readings speculative. This is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched with\n                     designs, became \"Holy Thursday\" in Songs of Innocence, 1789\n                     (Bentley plate 19). For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 18-20. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     93-94n). This line was probably written in the break between the original stanzas 2\n                     and 3 as a replacement for the final line of stanza 2 (line 21) after Blake had\n                     deleted it. A four-line stanza (lines 23-26) has been\n                     deleted. After it was deleted, the second couplet (lines 25-26) was not reused;\n                     the first couplet (lines 23-24) was rewritten and used to introduce the revised\n                     stanza below (lines 27-30). This unrhymed line is unique in a poem otherwise\n                     written in couplets. Erdman reads \"Cherubim & Seraphim\" (page 850n). Lines 28-31 make up the revised stanza that\n                     replaces the deleted four-line stanza (lines 23-26) and the unrhymed verse that\n                     follows (line 27). A second lowercase \"g\" is written over the original \"g\" in \"among\", perhaps\n                     to strengthen it.  Bentley reads the deletion as \"Mrs Sistagatist\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 896). Bentley reads the deletion as \"Grand\" (Writings volume 2, page 896). \"The voice\" is washed out. These lines\n                     (35-44) make up the opening two stanzas of the earliest known draft of the poem\n                     that, etched with designs, became \"Nurse's Song\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 24). The poem continues on the next page\n                     of the manuscript. For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 94-95n. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     94-95n). The spacing and\n                     lettering suggest that the line originally began \"The tongues\". Blake then\n                     inserted \"When\" before \"The\" and altered \"The\" to \"the\" to read \"When the\n                     tongues\". These two stanzas (lines 1-11) complete the draft of \"Nurse's Song\"\n                     that begins on the previous page (14.35-44). Erdman outlines the sequence of revisions thus: Blake originally wrote\n                     \"cannot go to sleep\", emended it to \"cannot sleep till its dark\", and then\n                     restored the original \"cannot go to sleep\" (page 850n). Phillips describes a\n                     similar sequence, but notes that the original \"go to\" was overwritten by \"get\n                     to\" and \"till its dark\" was added to the line (to read \"and we cannot get to\n                     sleep till its dark\"). Phillips claims that Blake then restored the original\n                     \"go to\" by a supralinear insertion and deleted \"till its dark\" (page 95n). See\n                     note for line 4 for additional information about Blake's revisions to these\n                     lines. Phillips gives a plausible account of the revisions in lines 2-4 that hinges\n                     on the notion that Blake, \"momentarily forgetting the rhyme scheme [abcb]\n                     established in the first stanzas on the preceding page\", wrote line 4, made\n                     some adjustments in lines 2-3, and then recognizing \"his mistake ... restored\n                     the original reading\" of line 3, deleted line 4, and then \"went on to write the\n                     next two lines\" in conformity with the original rhyme scheme (page 95n). Erdman reads a lowercase initial \"s\" in the undeleted \"Sung Quid\" at the end\n                     of the line (page 463). This (lines 13-20) is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched\n                     with designs, became \"The Little Boy lost\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 13). Phillips prints a version of the\n                     poem that displays the differences between this and the etched version (page\n                     96). The word \"turd\" is deleted and replaced by \"tansey\", written in\n                     lighter ink. Erdman reads the beginning of the deletion as \"To hit me\" (page\n                     850n). Erdman reads \"a[ny bird the\"\n                     (page 850n); Bentley \"[\u00e2\u0080\u0083 \u00e2\u0080\u0083d he del]\" (Writings volume 2, page 897); Phillips \"an old\n                        he (page 56). Phillips reads \"began-\" (page 56). The phrase \"leave to\" is presumably a slip for\n                     \"leave me to\". \"O\" is written over \"l\" (probably the start of \"leave\",\n                     conjectures Erdman, page 850n). Two lines (15-16) have been deleted, leaving them only partly legible. They\n                     may read (with Erdman page 850n), \"How many Blackamoors / Coud sing with their\n                     thick lips\". Blake may have originally started line 15 with \"If\" before\n                     changing to \"How\" (Erdman page 850n). Bentley reads line 15 less confidently:\n                        \"If(?) we(?) manage(?)\n                     Blackamoors\" (Writings volume 2, page 898). And there is\n                     considerable uncertainty in the reading of the first word of line 16, which may\n                     be \"Will\" (Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 898), \"Coud\"\n                     (Erdman page 850n), or \"cant\" (Phillips page 59). Bentley reads the opening word of the line as \"thus\" (Writings volume 2, page 899). Phillips reads the deleted word(s) following \"other\" as \"sheet a\" (page 60).\n                     Bentley notes only \"word del\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 899), while Erdman does not note the deletion. Bentley reads \"Sicknackers\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899), Phillips \"Sicknakers\" (page 60). Between \"people\" and \"who\" is a stroke \u00e2\u0080\u0094 probably a false start\n                     \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that Phillips reads as a short dash (page 60). \"abilies\": i.e., presumably, a slip for \"abilities\".\n                     Bentley reads \"abilies\" as \"abities\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899).  \"yo\": i.e.,\n                     presumably, a slip for \"you\". The illegible letters and \"William Blake\" have been\n                  smudged. All of the text in this line has\n                     been smudged. The \"N\" has been\n                     smudged. The gap indicates a partial letter. It may be the backstroke for a capital\n                     letter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 perhaps \"B\". At the beginning of the line\n                     are two partial letters. The first may be a partial capital \"T\" or \"F\". The\n                     second is a small partial stroke. The second legible \"n\" has been\n                     smudged. The text has been smudged. The \"m\" has been smudged. The words \"William Blake\" appear to\n                     have been cancelled.  \"Lamb\", written in a very small hand, is\n                     almost obscured by the first large \"n\". The second \"n\" has been lightly\n                     smudged. The illegible text at the end of the line appears to be a partial\n                     letter\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps \"c\" or \"o\". The illegible text could be the capital letter \"L\" or simply a\n                     squiggle. The letters \"Bl\" (followed by an uncertain letter \"a\") are written in\n                     backwards lettering. They are also smudged. The\n                     text has been smudged, and is written vertically in the lower right quadrant of\n                     the page. The blank verso of this leaf, designated as page B in Bentley and showing a\n                  considerable amount of show-through of the writing on this recto, is not\n                  reproduced here. Two or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time\n                  prior to 1905, between leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). Refer to\n                  the Work Information for more details about the manuscript. A diagonal pencil\n                  inscription at the bottom of the page, not in Blake's hand, reads, \"a leaf is\n                  evidently missing before this one\". At least some of the sketches and lettering on the verso (reproduced here) may\n                  conceivably be the product of both William Blake and his youngest brother Robert\n                  (1762-87). The awkwardness and redundancy of some of the work, the bare geometry\n                  of the head of the large lion(?) in the lower pair of animals in the upper left\n                  quadrant of the page, and the heavy overdrawing on some of the other animals are\n                  among the features that may possibly reflect Robert's attempts to draw subjects\n                  that had been set as exercises for him by older brother William, and, in some\n                  instances, corrected by one of them.The blank recto, designated as page O in Bentley, and showing a considerable\n                  amount of show-through from the ink lines on this verso, is not reproduced\n                  here.",

        "notes": "Bentley designates these as pages 1-16, A, P. Not included here,\n                  among the 18 objects, are the blank verso of object 17 (Bentley page B) and the\n                  blank recto of object 18 (Bentley page O). We are also not including Bentley pages\n                  C-N, all blanks, which are now housed separately from the leaves bearing the\n                  manuscript. Each leaf was originally half of a folio (2 conjugate leaves). Two\n                  or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time prior to 1905, between\n                  leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). The verso of leaf 9 (page B in\n                  Bentley) and the recto of what is now leaf 10 (formerly leaf 16, page O in\n                  Bentley) are blank. These blank pages are not reproduced here. Before rebinding in\n                  1978, there were 6 blank leaves (Bentley pages C-N) of the same paper that bears\n                  the manuscript between what are now leaves 9 and 10 (objects 17-18 as numbered\n                  here). As the sequence of watermarks and countermarks indicates, these blank\n                  leaves were once conjugate with the manuscript. The verso of the final leaf\n                  (object 18 as numbered here and page P in Bentley) bears assorted drawings and\n                  inscriptions. It is included in Butlin's catalogue (no. 149) as \"The Lamb Lying\n                  Down with the Lion and Other Drawings, from 'An Island in the Moon' Manuscript.\"\n                      The watermark appears on leaves 2-8, 10 (objects 3-16, 18 as numbered\n                  here). A countermark, consisting of the letters \"G R\" under a crown, appears on\n                  leaves 1 and 9 (objects 1-2, 17 as numbered here). Object 3 is numbered both 1 and 2 upper left and 5 upper right;\n                  object 5 is numbered 3 upper left and 6 upper right. Objects 7, 11, 13, and 15 are\n                  numbered 9, 6, 7, and 8 upper left. All these numbers are in pencil. They are\n                  probably not written by Blake and thus are not included in our\n                  transcriptions. Each manuscript leaf is mounted\n                  in a paper frame. The present binding was created in 1978; formerly bound in red\n                  morocco with each leaf attached to a stub. The former binding included a\n                  proofsheet of Blake's woodcuts for Robert John Thornton's Pastorals\n                     of Virgil (1821) and a note from A.H. Palmer referring to their\n                  provenance.  Early history not known. Acquired before 1893 by Charles Fairfax Murray; given by\n               Murray to the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1905. A Fitzwilliam Museum collection stamp\n               appears on the verso of the final leaf (object 18 here). Erdman reads the deletion as \"tipsy\" (page 449), Bentley as illegible\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 875), and Phillips as \"tipsy\n                     &\" (page 28). Blake may have first written \"endeavourd\" or \"endeavoured\" before altering\n                     the word to \"endeavouring\". Erdman (page 449) and Phillips (page 28) read \"imagination\" as\n                     \"imaginations\".  Various attempts have been made to\n                     decipher the illegible deletions in lines 24-25. The deletion in line 24\n                     appears to have been an inserted addition following \"Philosophers\" in line 25.\n                     Bentley reads the deletion as \"Quid\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876); Phillips as \"the older\" (page 28); Erdman as \"Quid\" (deleted), replaced\n                     by \"the Older\", mended to \"the Elder\", deleted in turn (pages 450,\n                     849n). \"Inffammable\": i.e., \"Inflammable\" (corrected by Blake,\n                     according to Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 876). In line 32,\n                     the letters \"ee\" in \"see\" appear to have been struck through. A word in line 35, presumably intended for \"Antiquarian\", is\n                     partly covered by an ink spot. A word in line 36, presumably intended for\n                     \"along\", is partly covered by an ink spot. Phillips (page 28) and Erdman (page 450) read\n                     \"outr\u00c3\u00a9\", Bentley \"outr\u00c3\u00a8\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876).  In line 2, the deleted words are probably\n                     \"here the\" (Phillips page 31) preceded by a partially deleted em-dash, but\n                     Bentley reads the deletions as \"----- had the\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 876), Erdman as \"here Etr\" (page 450). In line 4, part of the the \"I\" in \"Inflammable\" has been cut\n                     away. Erdman emends \"staring\" to\n                     \"star[t]ing\" (page 450). \"Obuse\":\n                     i.e., presumably, \"Obtuse\". Erdman (mistakenly) reads an inserted \"said\" just after the deletion\n                     (page 450). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878) and Phillips (page\n                     32) read the deletion as \"and\"; Erdman (page 451) reads it as \"Miss\". Our\n                     reading of \"and\" is uncertain. Phillips reads \"Ma\" instead of \"M.rs\n                     Sigtagatist\" (32). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" instead of \"Sigtagatist\"\n                     throughout (Writings volume 2), but, as Erdman indicates,\n                     \"The name 'Sigtagatist' was first written 'Sistagatist' in most places, but\n                     mended\" (page 849n). In lines 3-7, it is possible that the women's names\n                     replace the deleted men's names, but this substitution is uncertain. Deleted at the end of the line is a phrase, \"All the three Philosophers\",\n                     followed by words that Bentley finds illegible (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878), Phillips reads as \"& very\" (page 32), and Erdman as\n                     \"and the three Philosophers com[in]g\" (page 849n). Our reading of these words\n                     (\"& very\") is uncertain.  In the deletion, Erdman reads \"& Suction\" (page 849n). In the deletion, Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878)\n                     and Erdman (page 849n) omit the \"&\". \"Gibble Gabble the wife of Inflammable\n                     Gass __\" may be part of a larger replacement of women's names for the deleted\n                     men's names in lines 4-6. In the deletion, Phillips omits the \"&\" after \"room\"\n                     (page 32). \"Little Scopprell ... the room\" may be part of a larger replacement\n                     of women's names for the deleted men's names in lines 4-6. \"*Arse\" apparently replaced the deleted\n                     \"Ass\" before both words were deleted and replaced by \"ass_\" (added in light\n                     ink). Erdman, on the basis of the asterisk, restores \"Arse\", to read the line\n                     as \"call me *Arse--)\" (pages 451, 849n). The deletion \"an\" is not noted by Bentley and Erdman. Bentley reads \"would\" as \"wants\" (Writings volume\n                     2, page 878). Bentley reads \"laught\" as \"laughd\" (Writings volume 2, page 878). Bentley reads the\n                     deleted word as \"Comparative(?)\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878). For \"answerd\" (line 31), Erdman reads\n                     \"?exclaimed\" (page 849n). Phillips reads the illegible deletion as \"Miss\"\n                     (page 32); Erdman describes it as a \"short illegible word ending in 'f'\" (page\n                     849n). Phillips reads the deleted phrase (in lines 39-40) as \"of / what you\n                     read\" (page 32), while Erdman reads \"of / what you st\" (page 452). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page 879) throughout. Blake has inserted a\n                     curly bracket that spans lines 10-11. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 880) throughout. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     880) throughout. Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and\n                     Erdman (page 453) read \"Mathematician\". \"why / I know that\" (spanning lines 16, 18) is deleted and then restored (in\n                     line 17) above the deletion and the underscore in line 18. Erdman reads the\n                     deletion as \"?obj Obtuse ?Angle\" (page 849n). The word \"whether\" may be \"whither\". Bentley reads the deletion (lines 31-32) as \"what is this gim(?) used for\" (Writings volume 2, page 849n). For\n                     \"Arsdology\" Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and Erdman\n                     (page 453) read \"Aridology\". Bentley reads \"Hagamy Hatomy\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 881). Erdman reads the deletion as \"Cha\" (page 451) and\n                     Phillips as \"the\" (page 36). Phillips reads the deletion as\n                     \"tw--\" (page 39) and Erdman as \"twen[ty]\" (page 454). Phillips reads the deletion as \"a-\" (page 39). There is a redundant stroke in the first \"p\" of\n                     \"Sipsop\". The deletion (\"bl\") is not noted by Bentley and\n                     Erdman. The heavily deleted words at the end of the line are illegible except for\n                     \"This is\" at the beginning and a lowercase \"f\" midway. Bentley ventures to\n                     decipher \"This is\" (Writings volume 2, page 885); Erdman,\n                     more aggressively, ventures \"This is unfair and ?I ?think\" (page 456). The ink used to delete this line is lighter than the original ink. The illegible deletion is not noted by Erdman. The last word of the line is\n                     \"as\", though Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 885) and Erdman\n                     (page 456) read \"a\" without comment. \"Sopprell\": i.e., presumably, a slip for\n                     \"Scopprell\". \"Gent\" is written over an obscured word\n                     ending in \"man\", deleted by wash. Erdman (page 848) and Phillips (page 43) read\n                     the deleted word at the end of the line as \"Gentleman\". The word \"about\" (an uncertain reading)\n                     is written over text that cannot be recovered. Bentley makes out \"three words del\" (Writings volume 2, page 886),\n                     while Erdman reads \"its a book about\" (page 456). Phillips renders the phrase\n                     as we do here, though he speculates further that the \"first reading may have\n                     been 'Steelyard then' written in light brown ink, evidently the same ink used\n                     to write the first reading 'Gentleman' immediately above. 'Steelyard then' was\n                     then deleted with a full nib in a series of flourishes ending in 'about'\" (page\n                     83n). With this line, Blake shifts to using a lighter\n                     ink. Bentley\n                     reads \"coach\" (Writings volume 2, page 886) instead of\n                     \"coaches\". Phillips reads the final word as \"ride\" but indicates that this reading is\n                     \"conjectured\" (pages 44, 84). Erdman and Bentley see only a three-word\n                     deletion: \"he does not\". Erdman omits the initial ampersand altogether (page\n                     457). Bentley leaves it standing, undeleted (Writings volume\n                     2, page 887). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 887) and Erdman (page 457) both read the last\n                     word of the deletion as \"Envying\". \"kins\" in \"lambkins\" is written over \"s\n                     do\" in \"lambs do\". Bentley reads \"that\" for \"That\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     888). For \"pritty\" Bentley reads \"pretty\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 889). In lines 29 and 31, \"about London / O no\" is legible but deleted \"by\n                     washing out\" (Phillips page 88n). Phillips reads this line\n                     as \"My\", \"written in very pale brown ink\", above \"Nannicantipot\" (pages 47,\n                     88n). But it seems rather to be \"tty\", mirroring the letters just above, in\n                     \"pritty\", and partly erased. In line 31, \"about Matches\" could be replacing the\n                     deleted \"O no\" in the same line and/or the deleted \"about London\" in line\n                     29. \"When\" is washed out but clearly legible above \"Then\", which replaces\n                     it. Erdman reads\n                     the deleted \"sweet\" as \"sweeter\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"?one\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"ll\" (page\n                     459); Bentley does not note the deletion. An erased \"f\", clearly visible before\n                     \"cock\", is the most visible remains of what may be \"This frog\", which was\n                     erased and overwritten with \"Sing co\" in \"Sing cock\" (Erdman page 849n,\n                     Phillips page 90n). The descender of a corrected \"p\" remains\n                     in the middle of \"Sipsop\". Bentley reads \"Sung\" for \"sung\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 891). An illegible\n                     letter or other mark may be deleted between \"Hail\" and \"fingerfooted\". Phillips\n                     reads this as an (undeleted) short dash, \"Hail - fingerfooted\" (page 48).\n                     Bentley and Erdman do not note it. Bentley reads \"widow\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"maidens\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"matrimony\" for \"Matrimony\" and \"how\" for \"How\" (Writings volume 2, page 892).  Erdman reads \"Cynic\" for \"cynic\" (page 460). For \"allways,\" Erdman (page 460) and Phillips (page 51) read\n                     \"always\". The word \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40). In the next line, the letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" are\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41), thus reversing the original order of those\n                     words.  The letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" is\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41). In the previous line, \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40), thus reversing the original order of those\n                  words. The \"s\" at\n                     the end of \"laws\" is made unclear by what may be a spot of ink. Erdman maintains that \"jet\" is \"mended from git\"\n                     (page 850n; also Phillips page 92n). Bentley reads \"give\" for \"gave\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 894). The horizontal line terminates in an area of wash. Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52) read\n                     \"foolish.--\". Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 894) and Erdman (page\n                     462) omit the period after \"louse\". Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52)\n                     read the deleted word at the end of the line, which begins with a legible \"cl\"\n                     and has been both struck through and erased, as \"climing\" (that is,\n                     climbing). Phillips reads a period\n                     after the comma (page 52). Bentley reads \"slides\"\n                     instead of \"sliders\" (Writings volume 2, page 894). Erdman reads a period after the dash (page 462). Erdman reads the deleted \"he\" after \"room.\", less probably, as \"Go\" (page\n                     462). Bentley reads the deletions that begin at the end of line 1 as \"you are\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 895), Erdman as \"you / ar\" (page\n                     462), Phillips as \"gas / --\" (page 55). Beyond the descender on the first word,\n                     the deletions are illegible and the readings speculative. This is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched with\n                     designs, became \"Holy Thursday\" in Songs of Innocence, 1789\n                     (Bentley plate 19). For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 18-20. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     93-94n). This line was probably written in the break between the original stanzas 2\n                     and 3 as a replacement for the final line of stanza 2 (line 21) after Blake had\n                     deleted it. A four-line stanza (lines 23-26) has been\n                     deleted. After it was deleted, the second couplet (lines 25-26) was not reused;\n                     the first couplet (lines 23-24) was rewritten and used to introduce the revised\n                     stanza below (lines 27-30). This unrhymed line is unique in a poem otherwise\n                     written in couplets. Erdman reads \"Cherubim & Seraphim\" (page 850n). Lines 28-31 make up the revised stanza that\n                     replaces the deleted four-line stanza (lines 23-26) and the unrhymed verse that\n                     follows (line 27). A second lowercase \"g\" is written over the original \"g\" in \"among\", perhaps\n                     to strengthen it.  Bentley reads the deletion as \"Mrs Sistagatist\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 896). Bentley reads the deletion as \"Grand\" (Writings volume 2, page 896). \"The voice\" is washed out. These lines\n                     (35-44) make up the opening two stanzas of the earliest known draft of the poem\n                     that, etched with designs, became \"Nurse's Song\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 24). The poem continues on the next page\n                     of the manuscript. For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 94-95n. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     94-95n). The spacing and\n                     lettering suggest that the line originally began \"The tongues\". Blake then\n                     inserted \"When\" before \"The\" and altered \"The\" to \"the\" to read \"When the\n                     tongues\". These two stanzas (lines 1-11) complete the draft of \"Nurse's Song\"\n                     that begins on the previous page (14.35-44). Erdman outlines the sequence of revisions thus: Blake originally wrote\n                     \"cannot go to sleep\", emended it to \"cannot sleep till its dark\", and then\n                     restored the original \"cannot go to sleep\" (page 850n). Phillips describes a\n                     similar sequence, but notes that the original \"go to\" was overwritten by \"get\n                     to\" and \"till its dark\" was added to the line (to read \"and we cannot get to\n                     sleep till its dark\"). Phillips claims that Blake then restored the original\n                     \"go to\" by a supralinear insertion and deleted \"till its dark\" (page 95n). See\n                     note for line 4 for additional information about Blake's revisions to these\n                     lines. Phillips gives a plausible account of the revisions in lines 2-4 that hinges\n                     on the notion that Blake, \"momentarily forgetting the rhyme scheme [abcb]\n                     established in the first stanzas on the preceding page\", wrote line 4, made\n                     some adjustments in lines 2-3, and then recognizing \"his mistake ... restored\n                     the original reading\" of line 3, deleted line 4, and then \"went on to write the\n                     next two lines\" in conformity with the original rhyme scheme (page 95n). Erdman reads a lowercase initial \"s\" in the undeleted \"Sung Quid\" at the end\n                     of the line (page 463). This (lines 13-20) is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched\n                     with designs, became \"The Little Boy lost\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 13). Phillips prints a version of the\n                     poem that displays the differences between this and the etched version (page\n                     96). The word \"turd\" is deleted and replaced by \"tansey\", written in\n                     lighter ink. Erdman reads the beginning of the deletion as \"To hit me\" (page\n                     850n). Erdman reads \"a[ny bird the\"\n                     (page 850n); Bentley \"[\u00e2\u0080\u0083 \u00e2\u0080\u0083d he del]\" (Writings volume 2, page 897); Phillips \"an old\n                        he (page 56). Phillips reads \"began-\" (page 56). The phrase \"leave to\" is presumably a slip for\n                     \"leave me to\". \"O\" is written over \"l\" (probably the start of \"leave\",\n                     conjectures Erdman, page 850n). Two lines (15-16) have been deleted, leaving them only partly legible. They\n                     may read (with Erdman page 850n), \"How many Blackamoors / Coud sing with their\n                     thick lips\". Blake may have originally started line 15 with \"If\" before\n                     changing to \"How\" (Erdman page 850n). Bentley reads line 15 less confidently:\n                        \"If(?) we(?) manage(?)\n                     Blackamoors\" (Writings volume 2, page 898). And there is\n                     considerable uncertainty in the reading of the first word of line 16, which may\n                     be \"Will\" (Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 898), \"Coud\"\n                     (Erdman page 850n), or \"cant\" (Phillips page 59). Bentley reads the opening word of the line as \"thus\" (Writings volume 2, page 899). Phillips reads the deleted word(s) following \"other\" as \"sheet a\" (page 60).\n                     Bentley notes only \"word del\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 899), while Erdman does not note the deletion. Bentley reads \"Sicknackers\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899), Phillips \"Sicknakers\" (page 60). Between \"people\" and \"who\" is a stroke \u00e2\u0080\u0094 probably a false start\n                     \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that Phillips reads as a short dash (page 60). \"abilies\": i.e., presumably, a slip for \"abilities\".\n                     Bentley reads \"abilies\" as \"abities\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899).  \"yo\": i.e.,\n                     presumably, a slip for \"you\". The illegible letters and \"William Blake\" have been\n                  smudged. All of the text in this line has\n                     been smudged. The \"N\" has been\n                     smudged. The gap indicates a partial letter. It may be the backstroke for a capital\n                     letter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 perhaps \"B\". At the beginning of the line\n                     are two partial letters. The first may be a partial capital \"T\" or \"F\". The\n                     second is a small partial stroke. The second legible \"n\" has been\n                     smudged. The text has been smudged. The \"m\" has been smudged. The words \"William Blake\" appear to\n                     have been cancelled.  \"Lamb\", written in a very small hand, is\n                     almost obscured by the first large \"n\". The second \"n\" has been lightly\n                     smudged. The illegible text at the end of the line appears to be a partial\n                     letter\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps \"c\" or \"o\". The illegible text could be the capital letter \"L\" or simply a\n                     squiggle. The letters \"Bl\" (followed by an uncertain letter \"a\") are written in\n                     backwards lettering. They are also smudged. The\n                     text has been smudged, and is written vertically in the lower right quadrant of\n                     the page. The blank verso of this leaf, designated as page B in Bentley and showing a\n                  considerable amount of show-through of the writing on this recto, is not\n                  reproduced here. Two or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time\n                  prior to 1905, between leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). Refer to\n                  the Work Information for more details about the manuscript. A diagonal pencil\n                  inscription at the bottom of the page, not in Blake's hand, reads, \"a leaf is\n                  evidently missing before this one\". At least some of the sketches and lettering on the verso (reproduced here) may\n                  conceivably be the product of both William Blake and his youngest brother Robert\n                  (1762-87). The awkwardness and redundancy of some of the work, the bare geometry\n                  of the head of the large lion(?) in the lower pair of animals in the upper left\n                  quadrant of the page, and the heavy overdrawing on some of the other animals are\n                  among the features that may possibly reflect Robert's attempts to draw subjects\n                  that had been set as exercises for him by older brother William, and, in some\n                  instances, corrected by one of them.The blank recto, designated as page O in Bentley, and showing a considerable\n                  amount of show-through from the ink lines on this verso, is not reproduced\n                  here.",

        "notes": "Bentley designates these as pages 1-16, A, P. Not included here,\n                  among the 18 objects, are the blank verso of object 17 (Bentley page B) and the\n                  blank recto of object 18 (Bentley page O). We are also not including Bentley pages\n                  C-N, all blanks, which are now housed separately from the leaves bearing the\n                  manuscript. Each leaf was originally half of a folio (2 conjugate leaves). Two\n                  or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time prior to 1905, between\n                  leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). The verso of leaf 9 (page B in\n                  Bentley) and the recto of what is now leaf 10 (formerly leaf 16, page O in\n                  Bentley) are blank. These blank pages are not reproduced here. Before rebinding in\n                  1978, there were 6 blank leaves (Bentley pages C-N) of the same paper that bears\n                  the manuscript between what are now leaves 9 and 10 (objects 17-18 as numbered\n                  here). As the sequence of watermarks and countermarks indicates, these blank\n                  leaves were once conjugate with the manuscript. The verso of the final leaf\n                  (object 18 as numbered here and page P in Bentley) bears assorted drawings and\n                  inscriptions. It is included in Butlin's catalogue (no. 149) as \"The Lamb Lying\n                  Down with the Lion and Other Drawings, from 'An Island in the Moon' Manuscript.\"\n                      The watermark appears on leaves 2-8, 10 (objects 3-16, 18 as numbered\n                  here). A countermark, consisting of the letters \"G R\" under a crown, appears on\n                  leaves 1 and 9 (objects 1-2, 17 as numbered here). Object 3 is numbered both 1 and 2 upper left and 5 upper right;\n                  object 5 is numbered 3 upper left and 6 upper right. Objects 7, 11, 13, and 15 are\n                  numbered 9, 6, 7, and 8 upper left. All these numbers are in pencil. They are\n                  probably not written by Blake and thus are not included in our\n                  transcriptions. Each manuscript leaf is mounted\n                  in a paper frame. The present binding was created in 1978; formerly bound in red\n                  morocco with each leaf attached to a stub. The former binding included a\n                  proofsheet of Blake's woodcuts for Robert John Thornton's Pastorals\n                     of Virgil (1821) and a note from A.H. Palmer referring to their\n                  provenance.  Early history not known. Acquired before 1893 by Charles Fairfax Murray; given by\n               Murray to the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1905. A Fitzwilliam Museum collection stamp\n               appears on the verso of the final leaf (object 18 here). Erdman reads the deletion as \"tipsy\" (page 449), Bentley as illegible\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 875), and Phillips as \"tipsy\n                     &\" (page 28). Blake may have first written \"endeavourd\" or \"endeavoured\" before altering\n                     the word to \"endeavouring\". Erdman (page 449) and Phillips (page 28) read \"imagination\" as\n                     \"imaginations\".  Various attempts have been made to\n                     decipher the illegible deletions in lines 24-25. The deletion in line 24\n                     appears to have been an inserted addition following \"Philosophers\" in line 25.\n                     Bentley reads the deletion as \"Quid\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876); Phillips as \"the older\" (page 28); Erdman as \"Quid\" (deleted), replaced\n                     by \"the Older\", mended to \"the Elder\", deleted in turn (pages 450,\n                     849n). \"Inffammable\": i.e., \"Inflammable\" (corrected by Blake,\n                     according to Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 876). In line 32,\n                     the letters \"ee\" in \"see\" appear to have been struck through. A word in line 35, presumably intended for \"Antiquarian\", is\n                     partly covered by an ink spot. A word in line 36, presumably intended for\n                     \"along\", is partly covered by an ink spot. Phillips (page 28) and Erdman (page 450) read\n                     \"outr\u00c3\u00a9\", Bentley \"outr\u00c3\u00a8\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876).  In line 2, the deleted words are probably\n                     \"here the\" (Phillips page 31) preceded by a partially deleted em-dash, but\n                     Bentley reads the deletions as \"----- had the\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 876), Erdman as \"here Etr\" (page 450). In line 4, part of the the \"I\" in \"Inflammable\" has been cut\n                     away. Erdman emends \"staring\" to\n                     \"star[t]ing\" (page 450). \"Obuse\":\n                     i.e., presumably, \"Obtuse\". Erdman (mistakenly) reads an inserted \"said\" just after the deletion\n                     (page 450). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878) and Phillips (page\n                     32) read the deletion as \"and\"; Erdman (page 451) reads it as \"Miss\". Our\n                     reading of \"and\" is uncertain. Phillips reads \"Ma\" instead of \"M.rs\n                     Sigtagatist\" (32). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" instead of \"Sigtagatist\"\n                     throughout (Writings volume 2), but, as Erdman indicates,\n                     \"The name 'Sigtagatist' was first written 'Sistagatist' in most places, but\n                     mended\" (page 849n). In lines 3-7, it is possible that the women's names\n                     replace the deleted men's names, but this substitution is uncertain. Deleted at the end of the line is a phrase, \"All the three Philosophers\",\n                     followed by words that Bentley finds illegible (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878), Phillips reads as \"& very\" (page 32), and Erdman as\n                     \"and the three Philosophers com[in]g\" (page 849n). Our reading of these words\n                     (\"& very\") is uncertain.  In the deletion, Erdman reads \"& Suction\" (page 849n). In the deletion, Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878)\n                     and Erdman (page 849n) omit the \"&\". \"Gibble Gabble the wife of Inflammable\n                     Gass __\" may be part of a larger replacement of women's names for the deleted\n                     men's names in lines 4-6. In the deletion, Phillips omits the \"&\" after \"room\"\n                     (page 32). \"Little Scopprell ... the room\" may be part of a larger replacement\n                     of women's names for the deleted men's names in lines 4-6. \"*Arse\" apparently replaced the deleted\n                     \"Ass\" before both words were deleted and replaced by \"ass_\" (added in light\n                     ink). Erdman, on the basis of the asterisk, restores \"Arse\", to read the line\n                     as \"call me *Arse--)\" (pages 451, 849n). The deletion \"an\" is not noted by Bentley and Erdman. Bentley reads \"would\" as \"wants\" (Writings volume\n                     2, page 878). Bentley reads \"laught\" as \"laughd\" (Writings volume 2, page 878). Bentley reads the\n                     deleted word as \"Comparative(?)\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878). For \"answerd\" (line 31), Erdman reads\n                     \"?exclaimed\" (page 849n). Phillips reads the illegible deletion as \"Miss\"\n                     (page 32); Erdman describes it as a \"short illegible word ending in 'f'\" (page\n                     849n). Phillips reads the deleted phrase (in lines 39-40) as \"of / what you\n                     read\" (page 32), while Erdman reads \"of / what you st\" (page 452). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page 879) throughout. Blake has inserted a\n                     curly bracket that spans lines 10-11. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 880) throughout. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     880) throughout. Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and\n                     Erdman (page 453) read \"Mathematician\". \"why / I know that\" (spanning lines 16, 18) is deleted and then restored (in\n                     line 17) above the deletion and the underscore in line 18. Erdman reads the\n                     deletion as \"?obj Obtuse ?Angle\" (page 849n). The word \"whether\" may be \"whither\". Bentley reads the deletion (lines 31-32) as \"what is this gim(?) used for\" (Writings volume 2, page 849n). For\n                     \"Arsdology\" Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and Erdman\n                     (page 453) read \"Aridology\". Bentley reads \"Hagamy Hatomy\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 881). Erdman reads the deletion as \"Cha\" (page 451) and\n                     Phillips as \"the\" (page 36). Phillips reads the deletion as\n                     \"tw--\" (page 39) and Erdman as \"twen[ty]\" (page 454). Phillips reads the deletion as \"a-\" (page 39). There is a redundant stroke in the first \"p\" of\n                     \"Sipsop\". The deletion (\"bl\") is not noted by Bentley and\n                     Erdman. The heavily deleted words at the end of the line are illegible except for\n                     \"This is\" at the beginning and a lowercase \"f\" midway. Bentley ventures to\n                     decipher \"This is\" (Writings volume 2, page 885); Erdman,\n                     more aggressively, ventures \"This is unfair and ?I ?think\" (page 456). The ink used to delete this line is lighter than the original ink. The illegible deletion is not noted by Erdman. The last word of the line is\n                     \"as\", though Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 885) and Erdman\n                     (page 456) read \"a\" without comment. \"Sopprell\": i.e., presumably, a slip for\n                     \"Scopprell\". \"Gent\" is written over an obscured word\n                     ending in \"man\", deleted by wash. Erdman (page 848) and Phillips (page 43) read\n                     the deleted word at the end of the line as \"Gentleman\". The word \"about\" (an uncertain reading)\n                     is written over text that cannot be recovered. Bentley makes out \"three words del\" (Writings volume 2, page 886),\n                     while Erdman reads \"its a book about\" (page 456). Phillips renders the phrase\n                     as we do here, though he speculates further that the \"first reading may have\n                     been 'Steelyard then' written in light brown ink, evidently the same ink used\n                     to write the first reading 'Gentleman' immediately above. 'Steelyard then' was\n                     then deleted with a full nib in a series of flourishes ending in 'about'\" (page\n                     83n). With this line, Blake shifts to using a lighter\n                     ink. Bentley\n                     reads \"coach\" (Writings volume 2, page 886) instead of\n                     \"coaches\". Phillips reads the final word as \"ride\" but indicates that this reading is\n                     \"conjectured\" (pages 44, 84). Erdman and Bentley see only a three-word\n                     deletion: \"he does not\". Erdman omits the initial ampersand altogether (page\n                     457). Bentley leaves it standing, undeleted (Writings volume\n                     2, page 887). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 887) and Erdman (page 457) both read the last\n                     word of the deletion as \"Envying\". \"kins\" in \"lambkins\" is written over \"s\n                     do\" in \"lambs do\". Bentley reads \"that\" for \"That\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     888). For \"pritty\" Bentley reads \"pretty\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 889). In lines 29 and 31, \"about London / O no\" is legible but deleted \"by\n                     washing out\" (Phillips page 88n). Phillips reads this line\n                     as \"My\", \"written in very pale brown ink\", above \"Nannicantipot\" (pages 47,\n                     88n). But it seems rather to be \"tty\", mirroring the letters just above, in\n                     \"pritty\", and partly erased. In line 31, \"about Matches\" could be replacing the\n                     deleted \"O no\" in the same line and/or the deleted \"about London\" in line\n                     29. \"When\" is washed out but clearly legible above \"Then\", which replaces\n                     it. Erdman reads\n                     the deleted \"sweet\" as \"sweeter\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"?one\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"ll\" (page\n                     459); Bentley does not note the deletion. An erased \"f\", clearly visible before\n                     \"cock\", is the most visible remains of what may be \"This frog\", which was\n                     erased and overwritten with \"Sing co\" in \"Sing cock\" (Erdman page 849n,\n                     Phillips page 90n). The descender of a corrected \"p\" remains\n                     in the middle of \"Sipsop\". Bentley reads \"Sung\" for \"sung\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 891). An illegible\n                     letter or other mark may be deleted between \"Hail\" and \"fingerfooted\". Phillips\n                     reads this as an (undeleted) short dash, \"Hail - fingerfooted\" (page 48).\n                     Bentley and Erdman do not note it. Bentley reads \"widow\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"maidens\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"matrimony\" for \"Matrimony\" and \"how\" for \"How\" (Writings volume 2, page 892).  Erdman reads \"Cynic\" for \"cynic\" (page 460). For \"allways,\" Erdman (page 460) and Phillips (page 51) read\n                     \"always\". The word \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40). In the next line, the letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" are\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41), thus reversing the original order of those\n                     words.  The letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" is\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41). In the previous line, \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40), thus reversing the original order of those\n                  words. The \"s\" at\n                     the end of \"laws\" is made unclear by what may be a spot of ink. Erdman maintains that \"jet\" is \"mended from git\"\n                     (page 850n; also Phillips page 92n). Bentley reads \"give\" for \"gave\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 894). The horizontal line terminates in an area of wash. Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52) read\n                     \"foolish.--\". Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 894) and Erdman (page\n                     462) omit the period after \"louse\". Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52)\n                     read the deleted word at the end of the line, which begins with a legible \"cl\"\n                     and has been both struck through and erased, as \"climing\" (that is,\n                     climbing). Phillips reads a period\n                     after the comma (page 52). Bentley reads \"slides\"\n                     instead of \"sliders\" (Writings volume 2, page 894). Erdman reads a period after the dash (page 462). Erdman reads the deleted \"he\" after \"room.\", less probably, as \"Go\" (page\n                     462). Bentley reads the deletions that begin at the end of line 1 as \"you are\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 895), Erdman as \"you / ar\" (page\n                     462), Phillips as \"gas / --\" (page 55). Beyond the descender on the first word,\n                     the deletions are illegible and the readings speculative. This is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched with\n                     designs, became \"Holy Thursday\" in Songs of Innocence, 1789\n                     (Bentley plate 19). For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 18-20. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     93-94n). This line was probably written in the break between the original stanzas 2\n                     and 3 as a replacement for the final line of stanza 2 (line 21) after Blake had\n                     deleted it. A four-line stanza (lines 23-26) has been\n                     deleted. After it was deleted, the second couplet (lines 25-26) was not reused;\n                     the first couplet (lines 23-24) was rewritten and used to introduce the revised\n                     stanza below (lines 27-30). This unrhymed line is unique in a poem otherwise\n                     written in couplets. Erdman reads \"Cherubim & Seraphim\" (page 850n). Lines 28-31 make up the revised stanza that\n                     replaces the deleted four-line stanza (lines 23-26) and the unrhymed verse that\n                     follows (line 27). A second lowercase \"g\" is written over the original \"g\" in \"among\", perhaps\n                     to strengthen it.  Bentley reads the deletion as \"Mrs Sistagatist\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 896). Bentley reads the deletion as \"Grand\" (Writings volume 2, page 896). \"The voice\" is washed out. These lines\n                     (35-44) make up the opening two stanzas of the earliest known draft of the poem\n                     that, etched with designs, became \"Nurse's Song\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 24). The poem continues on the next page\n                     of the manuscript. For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 94-95n. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     94-95n). The spacing and\n                     lettering suggest that the line originally began \"The tongues\". Blake then\n                     inserted \"When\" before \"The\" and altered \"The\" to \"the\" to read \"When the\n                     tongues\". These two stanzas (lines 1-11) complete the draft of \"Nurse's Song\"\n                     that begins on the previous page (14.35-44). Erdman outlines the sequence of revisions thus: Blake originally wrote\n                     \"cannot go to sleep\", emended it to \"cannot sleep till its dark\", and then\n                     restored the original \"cannot go to sleep\" (page 850n). Phillips describes a\n                     similar sequence, but notes that the original \"go to\" was overwritten by \"get\n                     to\" and \"till its dark\" was added to the line (to read \"and we cannot get to\n                     sleep till its dark\"). Phillips claims that Blake then restored the original\n                     \"go to\" by a supralinear insertion and deleted \"till its dark\" (page 95n). See\n                     note for line 4 for additional information about Blake's revisions to these\n                     lines. Phillips gives a plausible account of the revisions in lines 2-4 that hinges\n                     on the notion that Blake, \"momentarily forgetting the rhyme scheme [abcb]\n                     established in the first stanzas on the preceding page\", wrote line 4, made\n                     some adjustments in lines 2-3, and then recognizing \"his mistake ... restored\n                     the original reading\" of line 3, deleted line 4, and then \"went on to write the\n                     next two lines\" in conformity with the original rhyme scheme (page 95n). Erdman reads a lowercase initial \"s\" in the undeleted \"Sung Quid\" at the end\n                     of the line (page 463). This (lines 13-20) is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched\n                     with designs, became \"The Little Boy lost\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 13). Phillips prints a version of the\n                     poem that displays the differences between this and the etched version (page\n                     96). The word \"turd\" is deleted and replaced by \"tansey\", written in\n                     lighter ink. Erdman reads the beginning of the deletion as \"To hit me\" (page\n                     850n). Erdman reads \"a[ny bird the\"\n                     (page 850n); Bentley \"[\u00e2\u0080\u0083 \u00e2\u0080\u0083d he del]\" (Writings volume 2, page 897); Phillips \"an old\n                        he (page 56). Phillips reads \"began-\" (page 56). The phrase \"leave to\" is presumably a slip for\n                     \"leave me to\". \"O\" is written over \"l\" (probably the start of \"leave\",\n                     conjectures Erdman, page 850n). Two lines (15-16) have been deleted, leaving them only partly legible. They\n                     may read (with Erdman page 850n), \"How many Blackamoors / Coud sing with their\n                     thick lips\". Blake may have originally started line 15 with \"If\" before\n                     changing to \"How\" (Erdman page 850n). Bentley reads line 15 less confidently:\n                        \"If(?) we(?) manage(?)\n                     Blackamoors\" (Writings volume 2, page 898). And there is\n                     considerable uncertainty in the reading of the first word of line 16, which may\n                     be \"Will\" (Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 898), \"Coud\"\n                     (Erdman page 850n), or \"cant\" (Phillips page 59). Bentley reads the opening word of the line as \"thus\" (Writings volume 2, page 899). Phillips reads the deleted word(s) following \"other\" as \"sheet a\" (page 60).\n                     Bentley notes only \"word del\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 899), while Erdman does not note the deletion. Bentley reads \"Sicknackers\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899), Phillips \"Sicknakers\" (page 60). Between \"people\" and \"who\" is a stroke \u00e2\u0080\u0094 probably a false start\n                     \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that Phillips reads as a short dash (page 60). \"abilies\": i.e., presumably, a slip for \"abilities\".\n                     Bentley reads \"abilies\" as \"abities\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899).  \"yo\": i.e.,\n                     presumably, a slip for \"you\". The illegible letters and \"William Blake\" have been\n                  smudged. All of the text in this line has\n                     been smudged. The \"N\" has been\n                     smudged. The gap indicates a partial letter. It may be the backstroke for a capital\n                     letter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 perhaps \"B\". At the beginning of the line\n                     are two partial letters. The first may be a partial capital \"T\" or \"F\". The\n                     second is a small partial stroke. The second legible \"n\" has been\n                     smudged. The text has been smudged. The \"m\" has been smudged. The words \"William Blake\" appear to\n                     have been cancelled.  \"Lamb\", written in a very small hand, is\n                     almost obscured by the first large \"n\". The second \"n\" has been lightly\n                     smudged. The illegible text at the end of the line appears to be a partial\n                     letter\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps \"c\" or \"o\". The illegible text could be the capital letter \"L\" or simply a\n                     squiggle. The letters \"Bl\" (followed by an uncertain letter \"a\") are written in\n                     backwards lettering. They are also smudged. The\n                     text has been smudged, and is written vertically in the lower right quadrant of\n                     the page. The blank verso of this leaf, designated as page B in Bentley and showing a\n                  considerable amount of show-through of the writing on this recto, is not\n                  reproduced here. Two or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time\n                  prior to 1905, between leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). Refer to\n                  the Work Information for more details about the manuscript. A diagonal pencil\n                  inscription at the bottom of the page, not in Blake's hand, reads, \"a leaf is\n                  evidently missing before this one\". At least some of the sketches and lettering on the verso (reproduced here) may\n                  conceivably be the product of both William Blake and his youngest brother Robert\n                  (1762-87). The awkwardness and redundancy of some of the work, the bare geometry\n                  of the head of the large lion(?) in the lower pair of animals in the upper left\n                  quadrant of the page, and the heavy overdrawing on some of the other animals are\n                  among the features that may possibly reflect Robert's attempts to draw subjects\n                  that had been set as exercises for him by older brother William, and, in some\n                  instances, corrected by one of them.The blank recto, designated as page O in Bentley, and showing a considerable\n                  amount of show-through from the ink lines on this verso, is not reproduced\n                  here.",

        "notes": "Bentley designates these as pages 1-16, A, P. Not included here,\n                  among the 18 objects, are the blank verso of object 17 (Bentley page B) and the\n                  blank recto of object 18 (Bentley page O). We are also not including Bentley pages\n                  C-N, all blanks, which are now housed separately from the leaves bearing the\n                  manuscript. Each leaf was originally half of a folio (2 conjugate leaves). Two\n                  or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time prior to 1905, between\n                  leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). The verso of leaf 9 (page B in\n                  Bentley) and the recto of what is now leaf 10 (formerly leaf 16, page O in\n                  Bentley) are blank. These blank pages are not reproduced here. Before rebinding in\n                  1978, there were 6 blank leaves (Bentley pages C-N) of the same paper that bears\n                  the manuscript between what are now leaves 9 and 10 (objects 17-18 as numbered\n                  here). As the sequence of watermarks and countermarks indicates, these blank\n                  leaves were once conjugate with the manuscript. The verso of the final leaf\n                  (object 18 as numbered here and page P in Bentley) bears assorted drawings and\n                  inscriptions. It is included in Butlin's catalogue (no. 149) as \"The Lamb Lying\n                  Down with the Lion and Other Drawings, from 'An Island in the Moon' Manuscript.\"\n                      The watermark appears on leaves 2-8, 10 (objects 3-16, 18 as numbered\n                  here). A countermark, consisting of the letters \"G R\" under a crown, appears on\n                  leaves 1 and 9 (objects 1-2, 17 as numbered here). Object 3 is numbered both 1 and 2 upper left and 5 upper right;\n                  object 5 is numbered 3 upper left and 6 upper right. Objects 7, 11, 13, and 15 are\n                  numbered 9, 6, 7, and 8 upper left. All these numbers are in pencil. They are\n                  probably not written by Blake and thus are not included in our\n                  transcriptions. Each manuscript leaf is mounted\n                  in a paper frame. The present binding was created in 1978; formerly bound in red\n                  morocco with each leaf attached to a stub. The former binding included a\n                  proofsheet of Blake's woodcuts for Robert John Thornton's Pastorals\n                     of Virgil (1821) and a note from A.H. Palmer referring to their\n                  provenance.  Early history not known. Acquired before 1893 by Charles Fairfax Murray; given by\n               Murray to the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1905. A Fitzwilliam Museum collection stamp\n               appears on the verso of the final leaf (object 18 here). Erdman reads the deletion as \"tipsy\" (page 449), Bentley as illegible\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 875), and Phillips as \"tipsy\n                     &\" (page 28). Blake may have first written \"endeavourd\" or \"endeavoured\" before altering\n                     the word to \"endeavouring\". Erdman (page 449) and Phillips (page 28) read \"imagination\" as\n                     \"imaginations\".  Various attempts have been made to\n                     decipher the illegible deletions in lines 24-25. The deletion in line 24\n                     appears to have been an inserted addition following \"Philosophers\" in line 25.\n                     Bentley reads the deletion as \"Quid\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876); Phillips as \"the older\" (page 28); Erdman as \"Quid\" (deleted), replaced\n                     by \"the Older\", mended to \"the Elder\", deleted in turn (pages 450,\n                     849n). \"Inffammable\": i.e., \"Inflammable\" (corrected by Blake,\n                     according to Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 876). In line 32,\n                     the letters \"ee\" in \"see\" appear to have been struck through. A word in line 35, presumably intended for \"Antiquarian\", is\n                     partly covered by an ink spot. A word in line 36, presumably intended for\n                     \"along\", is partly covered by an ink spot. Phillips (page 28) and Erdman (page 450) read\n                     \"outr\u00c3\u00a9\", Bentley \"outr\u00c3\u00a8\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876).  In line 2, the deleted words are probably\n                     \"here the\" (Phillips page 31) preceded by a partially deleted em-dash, but\n                     Bentley reads the deletions as \"----- had the\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 876), Erdman as \"here Etr\" (page 450). In line 4, part of the the \"I\" in \"Inflammable\" has been cut\n                     away. Erdman emends \"staring\" to\n                     \"star[t]ing\" (page 450). \"Obuse\":\n                     i.e., presumably, \"Obtuse\". Erdman (mistakenly) reads an inserted \"said\" just after the deletion\n                     (page 450). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878) and Phillips (page\n                     32) read the deletion as \"and\"; Erdman (page 451) reads it as \"Miss\". Our\n                     reading of \"and\" is uncertain. Phillips reads \"Ma\" instead of \"M.rs\n                     Sigtagatist\" (32). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" instead of \"Sigtagatist\"\n                     throughout (Writings volume 2), but, as Erdman indicates,\n                     \"The name 'Sigtagatist' was first written 'Sistagatist' in most places, but\n                     mended\" (page 849n). In lines 3-7, it is possible that the women's names\n                     replace the deleted men's names, but this substitution is uncertain. Deleted at the end of the line is a phrase, \"All the three Philosophers\",\n                     followed by words that Bentley finds illegible (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878), Phillips reads as \"& very\" (page 32), and Erdman as\n                     \"and the three Philosophers com[in]g\" (page 849n). Our reading of these words\n                     (\"& very\") is uncertain.  In the deletion, Erdman reads \"& Suction\" (page 849n). In the deletion, Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878)\n                     and Erdman (page 849n) omit the \"&\". \"Gibble Gabble the wife of Inflammable\n                     Gass __\" may be part of a larger replacement of women's names for the deleted\n                     men's names in lines 4-6. In the deletion, Phillips omits the \"&\" after \"room\"\n                     (page 32). \"Little Scopprell ... the room\" may be part of a larger replacement\n                     of women's names for the deleted men's names in lines 4-6. \"*Arse\" apparently replaced the deleted\n                     \"Ass\" before both words were deleted and replaced by \"ass_\" (added in light\n                     ink). Erdman, on the basis of the asterisk, restores \"Arse\", to read the line\n                     as \"call me *Arse--)\" (pages 451, 849n). The deletion \"an\" is not noted by Bentley and Erdman. Bentley reads \"would\" as \"wants\" (Writings volume\n                     2, page 878). Bentley reads \"laught\" as \"laughd\" (Writings volume 2, page 878). Bentley reads the\n                     deleted word as \"Comparative(?)\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878). For \"answerd\" (line 31), Erdman reads\n                     \"?exclaimed\" (page 849n). Phillips reads the illegible deletion as \"Miss\"\n                     (page 32); Erdman describes it as a \"short illegible word ending in 'f'\" (page\n                     849n). Phillips reads the deleted phrase (in lines 39-40) as \"of / what you\n                     read\" (page 32), while Erdman reads \"of / what you st\" (page 452). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page 879) throughout. Blake has inserted a\n                     curly bracket that spans lines 10-11. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 880) throughout. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     880) throughout. Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and\n                     Erdman (page 453) read \"Mathematician\". \"why / I know that\" (spanning lines 16, 18) is deleted and then restored (in\n                     line 17) above the deletion and the underscore in line 18. Erdman reads the\n                     deletion as \"?obj Obtuse ?Angle\" (page 849n). The word \"whether\" may be \"whither\". Bentley reads the deletion (lines 31-32) as \"what is this gim(?) used for\" (Writings volume 2, page 849n). For\n                     \"Arsdology\" Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and Erdman\n                     (page 453) read \"Aridology\". Bentley reads \"Hagamy Hatomy\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 881). Erdman reads the deletion as \"Cha\" (page 451) and\n                     Phillips as \"the\" (page 36). Phillips reads the deletion as\n                     \"tw--\" (page 39) and Erdman as \"twen[ty]\" (page 454). Phillips reads the deletion as \"a-\" (page 39). There is a redundant stroke in the first \"p\" of\n                     \"Sipsop\". The deletion (\"bl\") is not noted by Bentley and\n                     Erdman. The heavily deleted words at the end of the line are illegible except for\n                     \"This is\" at the beginning and a lowercase \"f\" midway. Bentley ventures to\n                     decipher \"This is\" (Writings volume 2, page 885); Erdman,\n                     more aggressively, ventures \"This is unfair and ?I ?think\" (page 456). The ink used to delete this line is lighter than the original ink. The illegible deletion is not noted by Erdman. The last word of the line is\n                     \"as\", though Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 885) and Erdman\n                     (page 456) read \"a\" without comment. \"Sopprell\": i.e., presumably, a slip for\n                     \"Scopprell\". \"Gent\" is written over an obscured word\n                     ending in \"man\", deleted by wash. Erdman (page 848) and Phillips (page 43) read\n                     the deleted word at the end of the line as \"Gentleman\". The word \"about\" (an uncertain reading)\n                     is written over text that cannot be recovered. Bentley makes out \"three words del\" (Writings volume 2, page 886),\n                     while Erdman reads \"its a book about\" (page 456). Phillips renders the phrase\n                     as we do here, though he speculates further that the \"first reading may have\n                     been 'Steelyard then' written in light brown ink, evidently the same ink used\n                     to write the first reading 'Gentleman' immediately above. 'Steelyard then' was\n                     then deleted with a full nib in a series of flourishes ending in 'about'\" (page\n                     83n). With this line, Blake shifts to using a lighter\n                     ink. Bentley\n                     reads \"coach\" (Writings volume 2, page 886) instead of\n                     \"coaches\". Phillips reads the final word as \"ride\" but indicates that this reading is\n                     \"conjectured\" (pages 44, 84). Erdman and Bentley see only a three-word\n                     deletion: \"he does not\". Erdman omits the initial ampersand altogether (page\n                     457). Bentley leaves it standing, undeleted (Writings volume\n                     2, page 887). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 887) and Erdman (page 457) both read the last\n                     word of the deletion as \"Envying\". \"kins\" in \"lambkins\" is written over \"s\n                     do\" in \"lambs do\". Bentley reads \"that\" for \"That\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     888). For \"pritty\" Bentley reads \"pretty\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 889). In lines 29 and 31, \"about London / O no\" is legible but deleted \"by\n                     washing out\" (Phillips page 88n). Phillips reads this line\n                     as \"My\", \"written in very pale brown ink\", above \"Nannicantipot\" (pages 47,\n                     88n). But it seems rather to be \"tty\", mirroring the letters just above, in\n                     \"pritty\", and partly erased. In line 31, \"about Matches\" could be replacing the\n                     deleted \"O no\" in the same line and/or the deleted \"about London\" in line\n                     29. \"When\" is washed out but clearly legible above \"Then\", which replaces\n                     it. Erdman reads\n                     the deleted \"sweet\" as \"sweeter\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"?one\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"ll\" (page\n                     459); Bentley does not note the deletion. An erased \"f\", clearly visible before\n                     \"cock\", is the most visible remains of what may be \"This frog\", which was\n                     erased and overwritten with \"Sing co\" in \"Sing cock\" (Erdman page 849n,\n                     Phillips page 90n). The descender of a corrected \"p\" remains\n                     in the middle of \"Sipsop\". Bentley reads \"Sung\" for \"sung\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 891). An illegible\n                     letter or other mark may be deleted between \"Hail\" and \"fingerfooted\". Phillips\n                     reads this as an (undeleted) short dash, \"Hail - fingerfooted\" (page 48).\n                     Bentley and Erdman do not note it. Bentley reads \"widow\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"maidens\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"matrimony\" for \"Matrimony\" and \"how\" for \"How\" (Writings volume 2, page 892).  Erdman reads \"Cynic\" for \"cynic\" (page 460). For \"allways,\" Erdman (page 460) and Phillips (page 51) read\n                     \"always\". The word \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40). In the next line, the letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" are\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41), thus reversing the original order of those\n                     words.  The letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" is\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41). In the previous line, \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40), thus reversing the original order of those\n                  words. The \"s\" at\n                     the end of \"laws\" is made unclear by what may be a spot of ink. Erdman maintains that \"jet\" is \"mended from git\"\n                     (page 850n; also Phillips page 92n). Bentley reads \"give\" for \"gave\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 894). The horizontal line terminates in an area of wash. Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52) read\n                     \"foolish.--\". Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 894) and Erdman (page\n                     462) omit the period after \"louse\". Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52)\n                     read the deleted word at the end of the line, which begins with a legible \"cl\"\n                     and has been both struck through and erased, as \"climing\" (that is,\n                     climbing). Phillips reads a period\n                     after the comma (page 52). Bentley reads \"slides\"\n                     instead of \"sliders\" (Writings volume 2, page 894). Erdman reads a period after the dash (page 462). Erdman reads the deleted \"he\" after \"room.\", less probably, as \"Go\" (page\n                     462). Bentley reads the deletions that begin at the end of line 1 as \"you are\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 895), Erdman as \"you / ar\" (page\n                     462), Phillips as \"gas / --\" (page 55). Beyond the descender on the first word,\n                     the deletions are illegible and the readings speculative. This is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched with\n                     designs, became \"Holy Thursday\" in Songs of Innocence, 1789\n                     (Bentley plate 19). For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 18-20. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     93-94n). This line was probably written in the break between the original stanzas 2\n                     and 3 as a replacement for the final line of stanza 2 (line 21) after Blake had\n                     deleted it. A four-line stanza (lines 23-26) has been\n                     deleted. After it was deleted, the second couplet (lines 25-26) was not reused;\n                     the first couplet (lines 23-24) was rewritten and used to introduce the revised\n                     stanza below (lines 27-30). This unrhymed line is unique in a poem otherwise\n                     written in couplets. Erdman reads \"Cherubim & Seraphim\" (page 850n). Lines 28-31 make up the revised stanza that\n                     replaces the deleted four-line stanza (lines 23-26) and the unrhymed verse that\n                     follows (line 27). A second lowercase \"g\" is written over the original \"g\" in \"among\", perhaps\n                     to strengthen it.  Bentley reads the deletion as \"Mrs Sistagatist\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 896). Bentley reads the deletion as \"Grand\" (Writings volume 2, page 896). \"The voice\" is washed out. These lines\n                     (35-44) make up the opening two stanzas of the earliest known draft of the poem\n                     that, etched with designs, became \"Nurse's Song\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 24). The poem continues on the next page\n                     of the manuscript. For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 94-95n. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     94-95n). The spacing and\n                     lettering suggest that the line originally began \"The tongues\". Blake then\n                     inserted \"When\" before \"The\" and altered \"The\" to \"the\" to read \"When the\n                     tongues\". These two stanzas (lines 1-11) complete the draft of \"Nurse's Song\"\n                     that begins on the previous page (14.35-44). Erdman outlines the sequence of revisions thus: Blake originally wrote\n                     \"cannot go to sleep\", emended it to \"cannot sleep till its dark\", and then\n                     restored the original \"cannot go to sleep\" (page 850n). Phillips describes a\n                     similar sequence, but notes that the original \"go to\" was overwritten by \"get\n                     to\" and \"till its dark\" was added to the line (to read \"and we cannot get to\n                     sleep till its dark\"). Phillips claims that Blake then restored the original\n                     \"go to\" by a supralinear insertion and deleted \"till its dark\" (page 95n). See\n                     note for line 4 for additional information about Blake's revisions to these\n                     lines. Phillips gives a plausible account of the revisions in lines 2-4 that hinges\n                     on the notion that Blake, \"momentarily forgetting the rhyme scheme [abcb]\n                     established in the first stanzas on the preceding page\", wrote line 4, made\n                     some adjustments in lines 2-3, and then recognizing \"his mistake ... restored\n                     the original reading\" of line 3, deleted line 4, and then \"went on to write the\n                     next two lines\" in conformity with the original rhyme scheme (page 95n). Erdman reads a lowercase initial \"s\" in the undeleted \"Sung Quid\" at the end\n                     of the line (page 463). This (lines 13-20) is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched\n                     with designs, became \"The Little Boy lost\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 13). Phillips prints a version of the\n                     poem that displays the differences between this and the etched version (page\n                     96). The word \"turd\" is deleted and replaced by \"tansey\", written in\n                     lighter ink. Erdman reads the beginning of the deletion as \"To hit me\" (page\n                     850n). Erdman reads \"a[ny bird the\"\n                     (page 850n); Bentley \"[\u00e2\u0080\u0083 \u00e2\u0080\u0083d he del]\" (Writings volume 2, page 897); Phillips \"an old\n                        he (page 56). Phillips reads \"began-\" (page 56). The phrase \"leave to\" is presumably a slip for\n                     \"leave me to\". \"O\" is written over \"l\" (probably the start of \"leave\",\n                     conjectures Erdman, page 850n). Two lines (15-16) have been deleted, leaving them only partly legible. They\n                     may read (with Erdman page 850n), \"How many Blackamoors / Coud sing with their\n                     thick lips\". Blake may have originally started line 15 with \"If\" before\n                     changing to \"How\" (Erdman page 850n). Bentley reads line 15 less confidently:\n                        \"If(?) we(?) manage(?)\n                     Blackamoors\" (Writings volume 2, page 898). And there is\n                     considerable uncertainty in the reading of the first word of line 16, which may\n                     be \"Will\" (Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 898), \"Coud\"\n                     (Erdman page 850n), or \"cant\" (Phillips page 59). Bentley reads the opening word of the line as \"thus\" (Writings volume 2, page 899). Phillips reads the deleted word(s) following \"other\" as \"sheet a\" (page 60).\n                     Bentley notes only \"word del\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 899), while Erdman does not note the deletion. Bentley reads \"Sicknackers\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899), Phillips \"Sicknakers\" (page 60). Between \"people\" and \"who\" is a stroke \u00e2\u0080\u0094 probably a false start\n                     \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that Phillips reads as a short dash (page 60). \"abilies\": i.e., presumably, a slip for \"abilities\".\n                     Bentley reads \"abilies\" as \"abities\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899).  \"yo\": i.e.,\n                     presumably, a slip for \"you\". The illegible letters and \"William Blake\" have been\n                  smudged. All of the text in this line has\n                     been smudged. The \"N\" has been\n                     smudged. The gap indicates a partial letter. It may be the backstroke for a capital\n                     letter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 perhaps \"B\". At the beginning of the line\n                     are two partial letters. The first may be a partial capital \"T\" or \"F\". The\n                     second is a small partial stroke. The second legible \"n\" has been\n                     smudged. The text has been smudged. The \"m\" has been smudged. The words \"William Blake\" appear to\n                     have been cancelled.  \"Lamb\", written in a very small hand, is\n                     almost obscured by the first large \"n\". The second \"n\" has been lightly\n                     smudged. The illegible text at the end of the line appears to be a partial\n                     letter\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps \"c\" or \"o\". The illegible text could be the capital letter \"L\" or simply a\n                     squiggle. The letters \"Bl\" (followed by an uncertain letter \"a\") are written in\n                     backwards lettering. They are also smudged. The\n                     text has been smudged, and is written vertically in the lower right quadrant of\n                     the page. The blank verso of this leaf, designated as page B in Bentley and showing a\n                  considerable amount of show-through of the writing on this recto, is not\n                  reproduced here. Two or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time\n                  prior to 1905, between leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). Refer to\n                  the Work Information for more details about the manuscript. A diagonal pencil\n                  inscription at the bottom of the page, not in Blake's hand, reads, \"a leaf is\n                  evidently missing before this one\". At least some of the sketches and lettering on the verso (reproduced here) may\n                  conceivably be the product of both William Blake and his youngest brother Robert\n                  (1762-87). The awkwardness and redundancy of some of the work, the bare geometry\n                  of the head of the large lion(?) in the lower pair of animals in the upper left\n                  quadrant of the page, and the heavy overdrawing on some of the other animals are\n                  among the features that may possibly reflect Robert's attempts to draw subjects\n                  that had been set as exercises for him by older brother William, and, in some\n                  instances, corrected by one of them.The blank recto, designated as page O in Bentley, and showing a considerable\n                  amount of show-through from the ink lines on this verso, is not reproduced\n                  here.",

Not included here,\n                  among the 18 objects, are the blank verso of object 17 (Bentley page B) and the\n                  blank recto of object 18 (Bentley page O). We are also not including Bentley pages\n                  C-N, all blanks, which are now housed separately from the leaves bearing the\n                  manuscript. Each leaf was originally half of a folio (2 conjugate leaves). Two\n                  or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time prior to 1905, between\n                  leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). The verso of leaf 9 (page B in\n                  Bentley) and the recto of what is now leaf 10 (formerly leaf 16, page O in\n                  Bentley) are blank. These blank pages are not reproduced here. Before rebinding in\n                  1978, there were 6 blank leaves (Bentley pages C-N) of the same paper that bears\n                  the manuscript between what are now leaves 9 and 10 (objects 17-18 as numbered\n                  here). As the sequence of watermarks and countermarks indicates, these blank\n                  leaves were once conjugate with the manuscript. The verso of the final leaf\n                  (object 18 as numbered here and page P in Bentley) bears assorted drawings and\n                  inscriptions. It is included in Butlin's catalogue (no. 149) as \"The Lamb Lying\n                  Down with the Lion and Other Drawings, from 'An Island in the Moon' Manuscript.\"\n                      The watermark appears on leaves 2-8, 10 (objects 3-16, 18 as numbered\n                  here). A countermark, consisting of the letters \"G R\" under a crown, appears on\n                  leaves 1 and 9 (objects 1-2, 17 as numbered here). Object 3 is numbered both 1 and 2 upper left and 5 upper right;\n                  object 5 is numbered 3 upper left and 6 upper right. Objects 7, 11, 13, and 15 are\n                  numbered 9, 6, 7, and 8 upper left. All these numbers are in pencil. They are\n                  probably not written by Blake and thus are not included in our\n                  transcriptions. Each manuscript leaf is mounted\n                  in a paper frame. The present binding was created in 1978; formerly bound in red\n                  morocco with each leaf attached to a stub. The former binding included a\n                  proofsheet of Blake's woodcuts for Robert John Thornton's Pastorals\n                     of Virgil (1821) and a note from A.H. Palmer referring to their\n                  provenance.  Early history not known. Acquired before 1893 by Charles Fairfax Murray; given by\n               Murray to the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1905. A Fitzwilliam Museum collection stamp\n               appears on the verso of the final leaf (object 18 here). Erdman reads the deletion as \"tipsy\" (page 449), Bentley as illegible\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 875), and Phillips as \"tipsy\n                     &\" (page 28). Blake may have first written \"endeavourd\" or \"endeavoured\" before altering\n                     the word to \"endeavouring\". Erdman (page 449) and Phillips (page 28) read \"imagination\" as\n                     \"imaginations\".  Various attempts have been made to\n                     decipher the illegible deletions in lines 24-25. The deletion in line 24\n                     appears to have been an inserted addition following \"Philosophers\" in line 25.\n                     Bentley reads the deletion as \"Quid\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876); Phillips as \"the older\" (page 28); Erdman as \"Quid\" (deleted), replaced\n                     by \"the Older\", mended to \"the Elder\", deleted in turn (pages 450,\n                     849n). \"Inffammable\": i.e., \"Inflammable\" (corrected by Blake,\n                     according to Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 876). In line 32,\n                     the letters \"ee\" in \"see\" appear to have been struck through. A word in line 35, presumably intended for \"Antiquarian\", is\n                     partly covered by an ink spot. A word in line 36, presumably intended for\n                     \"along\", is partly covered by an ink spot. Phillips (page 28) and Erdman (page 450) read\n                     \"outr\u00c3\u00a9\", Bentley \"outr\u00c3\u00a8\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876).  In line 2, the deleted words are probably\n                     \"here the\" (Phillips page 31) preceded by a partially deleted em-dash, but\n                     Bentley reads the deletions as \"----- had the\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 876), Erdman as \"here Etr\" (page 450). In line 4, part of the the \"I\" in \"Inflammable\" has been cut\n                     away. Erdman emends \"staring\" to\n                     \"star[t]ing\" (page 450). \"Obuse\":\n                     i.e., presumably, \"Obtuse\". Erdman (mistakenly) reads an inserted \"said\" just after the deletion\n                     (page 450). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878) and Phillips (page\n                     32) read the deletion as \"and\"; Erdman (page 451) reads it as \"Miss\". Our\n                     reading of \"and\" is uncertain. Phillips reads \"Ma\" instead of \"M.rs\n                     Sigtagatist\" (32). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" instead of \"Sigtagatist\"\n                     throughout (Writings volume 2), but, as Erdman indicates,\n                     \"The name 'Sigtagatist' was first written 'Sistagatist' in most places, but\n                     mended\" (page 849n). In lines 3-7, it is possible that the women's names\n                     replace the deleted men's names, but this substitution is uncertain. Deleted at the end of the line is a phrase, \"All the three Philosophers\",\n                     followed by words that Bentley finds illegible (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878), Phillips reads as \"& very\" (page 32), and Erdman as\n                     \"and the three Philosophers com[in]g\" (page 849n). Our reading of these words\n                     (\"& very\") is uncertain.  In the deletion, Erdman reads \"& Suction\" (page 849n). In the deletion, Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878)\n                     and Erdman (page 849n) omit the \"&\". \"Gibble Gabble the wife of Inflammable\n                     Gass __\" may be part of a larger replacement of women's names for the deleted\n                     men's names in lines 4-6. In the deletion, Phillips omits the \"&\" after \"room\"\n                     (page 32). \"Little Scopprell ... the room\" may be part of a larger replacement\n                     of women's names for the deleted men's names in lines 4-6. \"*Arse\" apparently replaced the deleted\n                     \"Ass\" before both words were deleted and replaced by \"ass_\" (added in light\n                     ink). Erdman, on the basis of the asterisk, restores \"Arse\", to read the line\n                     as \"call me *Arse--)\" (pages 451, 849n). The deletion \"an\" is not noted by Bentley and Erdman. Bentley reads \"would\" as \"wants\" (Writings volume\n                     2, page 878). Bentley reads \"laught\" as \"laughd\" (Writings volume 2, page 878). Bentley reads the\n                     deleted word as \"Comparative(?)\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878). For \"answerd\" (line 31), Erdman reads\n                     \"?exclaimed\" (page 849n). Phillips reads the illegible deletion as \"Miss\"\n                     (page 32); Erdman describes it as a \"short illegible word ending in 'f'\" (page\n                     849n). Phillips reads the deleted phrase (in lines 39-40) as \"of / what you\n                     read\" (page 32), while Erdman reads \"of / what you st\" (page 452). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page 879) throughout. Blake has inserted a\n                     curly bracket that spans lines 10-11. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 880) throughout. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     880) throughout. Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and\n                     Erdman (page 453) read \"Mathematician\". \"why / I know that\" (spanning lines 16, 18) is deleted and then restored (in\n                     line 17) above the deletion and the underscore in line 18. Erdman reads the\n                     deletion as \"?obj Obtuse ?Angle\" (page 849n). The word \"whether\" may be \"whither\". Bentley reads the deletion (lines 31-32) as \"what is this gim(?) used for\" (Writings volume 2, page 849n). For\n                     \"Arsdology\" Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and Erdman\n                     (page 453) read \"Aridology\". Bentley reads \"Hagamy Hatomy\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 881). Erdman reads the deletion as \"Cha\" (page 451) and\n                     Phillips as \"the\" (page 36). Phillips reads the deletion as\n                     \"tw--\" (page 39) and Erdman as \"twen[ty]\" (page 454). Phillips reads the deletion as \"a-\" (page 39). There is a redundant stroke in the first \"p\" of\n                     \"Sipsop\". The deletion (\"bl\") is not noted by Bentley and\n                     Erdman. The heavily deleted words at the end of the line are illegible except for\n                     \"This is\" at the beginning and a lowercase \"f\" midway. Bentley ventures to\n                     decipher \"This is\" (Writings volume 2, page 885); Erdman,\n                     more aggressively, ventures \"This is unfair and ?I ?think\" (page 456). The ink used to delete this line is lighter than the original ink. The illegible deletion is not noted by Erdman. The last word of the line is\n                     \"as\", though Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 885) and Erdman\n                     (page 456) read \"a\" without comment. \"Sopprell\": i.e., presumably, a slip for\n                     \"Scopprell\". \"Gent\" is written over an obscured word\n                     ending in \"man\", deleted by wash. Erdman (page 848) and Phillips (page 43) read\n                     the deleted word at the end of the line as \"Gentleman\". The word \"about\" (an uncertain reading)\n                     is written over text that cannot be recovered. Bentley makes out \"three words del\" (Writings volume 2, page 886),\n                     while Erdman reads \"its a book about\" (page 456). Phillips renders the phrase\n                     as we do here, though he speculates further that the \"first reading may have\n                     been 'Steelyard then' written in light brown ink, evidently the same ink used\n                     to write the first reading 'Gentleman' immediately above. 'Steelyard then' was\n                     then deleted with a full nib in a series of flourishes ending in 'about'\" (page\n                     83n). With this line, Blake shifts to using a lighter\n                     ink. Bentley\n                     reads \"coach\" (Writings volume 2, page 886) instead of\n                     \"coaches\". Phillips reads the final word as \"ride\" but indicates that this reading is\n                     \"conjectured\" (pages 44, 84). Erdman and Bentley see only a three-word\n                     deletion: \"he does not\". Erdman omits the initial ampersand altogether (page\n                     457). Bentley leaves it standing, undeleted (Writings volume\n                     2, page 887). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 887) and Erdman (page 457) both read the last\n                     word of the deletion as \"Envying\". \"kins\" in \"lambkins\" is written over \"s\n                     do\" in \"lambs do\". Bentley reads \"that\" for \"That\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     888). For \"pritty\" Bentley reads \"pretty\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 889). In lines 29 and 31, \"about London / O no\" is legible but deleted \"by\n                     washing out\" (Phillips page 88n). Phillips reads this line\n                     as \"My\", \"written in very pale brown ink\", above \"Nannicantipot\" (pages 47,\n                     88n). But it seems rather to be \"tty\", mirroring the letters just above, in\n                     \"pritty\", and partly erased. In line 31, \"about Matches\" could be replacing the\n                     deleted \"O no\" in the same line and/or the deleted \"about London\" in line\n                     29. \"When\" is washed out but clearly legible above \"Then\", which replaces\n                     it. Erdman reads\n                     the deleted \"sweet\" as \"sweeter\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"?one\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"ll\" (page\n                     459); Bentley does not note the deletion. An erased \"f\", clearly visible before\n                     \"cock\", is the most visible remains of what may be \"This frog\", which was\n                     erased and overwritten with \"Sing co\" in \"Sing cock\" (Erdman page 849n,\n                     Phillips page 90n). The descender of a corrected \"p\" remains\n                     in the middle of \"Sipsop\". Bentley reads \"Sung\" for \"sung\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 891). An illegible\n                     letter or other mark may be deleted between \"Hail\" and \"fingerfooted\". Phillips\n                     reads this as an (undeleted) short dash, \"Hail - fingerfooted\" (page 48).\n                     Bentley and Erdman do not note it. Bentley reads \"widow\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"maidens\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"matrimony\" for \"Matrimony\" and \"how\" for \"How\" (Writings volume 2, page 892).  Erdman reads \"Cynic\" for \"cynic\" (page 460). For \"allways,\" Erdman (page 460) and Phillips (page 51) read\n                     \"always\". The word \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40). In the next line, the letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" are\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41), thus reversing the original order of those\n                     words.  The letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" is\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41). In the previous line, \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40), thus reversing the original order of those\n                  words. The \"s\" at\n                     the end of \"laws\" is made unclear by what may be a spot of ink. Erdman maintains that \"jet\" is \"mended from git\"\n                     (page 850n; also Phillips page 92n). Bentley reads \"give\" for \"gave\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 894). The horizontal line terminates in an area of wash. Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52) read\n                     \"foolish.--\". Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 894) and Erdman (page\n                     462) omit the period after \"louse\". Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52)\n                     read the deleted word at the end of the line, which begins with a legible \"cl\"\n                     and has been both struck through and erased, as \"climing\" (that is,\n                     climbing). Phillips reads a period\n                     after the comma (page 52). Bentley reads \"slides\"\n                     instead of \"sliders\" (Writings volume 2, page 894). Erdman reads a period after the dash (page 462). Erdman reads the deleted \"he\" after \"room.\", less probably, as \"Go\" (page\n                     462). Bentley reads the deletions that begin at the end of line 1 as \"you are\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 895), Erdman as \"you / ar\" (page\n                     462), Phillips as \"gas / --\" (page 55). Beyond the descender on the first word,\n                     the deletions are illegible and the readings speculative. This is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched with\n                     designs, became \"Holy Thursday\" in Songs of Innocence, 1789\n                     (Bentley plate 19). For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 18-20. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     93-94n). This line was probably written in the break between the original stanzas 2\n                     and 3 as a replacement for the final line of stanza 2 (line 21) after Blake had\n                     deleted it. A four-line stanza (lines 23-26) has been\n                     deleted. After it was deleted, the second couplet (lines 25-26) was not reused;\n                     the first couplet (lines 23-24) was rewritten and used to introduce the revised\n                     stanza below (lines 27-30). This unrhymed line is unique in a poem otherwise\n                     written in couplets. Erdman reads \"Cherubim & Seraphim\" (page 850n). Lines 28-31 make up the revised stanza that\n                     replaces the deleted four-line stanza (lines 23-26) and the unrhymed verse that\n                     follows (line 27). A second lowercase \"g\" is written over the original \"g\" in \"among\", perhaps\n                     to strengthen it.  Bentley reads the deletion as \"Mrs Sistagatist\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 896). Bentley reads the deletion as \"Grand\" (Writings volume 2, page 896). \"The voice\" is washed out. These lines\n                     (35-44) make up the opening two stanzas of the earliest known draft of the poem\n                     that, etched with designs, became \"Nurse's Song\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 24). The poem continues on the next page\n                     of the manuscript. For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 94-95n. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     94-95n). The spacing and\n                     lettering suggest that the line originally began \"The tongues\". Blake then\n                     inserted \"When\" before \"The\" and altered \"The\" to \"the\" to read \"When the\n                     tongues\". These two stanzas (lines 1-11) complete the draft of \"Nurse's Song\"\n                     that begins on the previous page (14.35-44). Erdman outlines the sequence of revisions thus: Blake originally wrote\n                     \"cannot go to sleep\", emended it to \"cannot sleep till its dark\", and then\n                     restored the original \"cannot go to sleep\" (page 850n). Phillips describes a\n                     similar sequence, but notes that the original \"go to\" was overwritten by \"get\n                     to\" and \"till its dark\" was added to the line (to read \"and we cannot get to\n                     sleep till its dark\"). Phillips claims that Blake then restored the original\n                     \"go to\" by a supralinear insertion and deleted \"till its dark\" (page 95n). See\n                     note for line 4 for additional information about Blake's revisions to these\n                     lines. Phillips gives a plausible account of the revisions in lines 2-4 that hinges\n                     on the notion that Blake, \"momentarily forgetting the rhyme scheme [abcb]\n                     established in the first stanzas on the preceding page\", wrote line 4, made\n                     some adjustments in lines 2-3, and then recognizing \"his mistake ... restored\n                     the original reading\" of line 3, deleted line 4, and then \"went on to write the\n                     next two lines\" in conformity with the original rhyme scheme (page 95n). Erdman reads a lowercase initial \"s\" in the undeleted \"Sung Quid\" at the end\n                     of the line (page 463). This (lines 13-20) is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched\n                     with designs, became \"The Little Boy lost\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 13). Phillips prints a version of the\n                     poem that displays the differences between this and the etched version (page\n                     96). The word \"turd\" is deleted and replaced by \"tansey\", written in\n                     lighter ink. Erdman reads the beginning of the deletion as \"To hit me\" (page\n                     850n). Erdman reads \"a[ny bird the\"\n                     (page 850n); Bentley \"[\u00e2\u0080\u0083 \u00e2\u0080\u0083d he del]\" (Writings volume 2, page 897); Phillips \"an old\n                        he (page 56). Phillips reads \"began-\" (page 56). The phrase \"leave to\" is presumably a slip for\n                     \"leave me to\". \"O\" is written over \"l\" (probably the start of \"leave\",\n                     conjectures Erdman, page 850n). Two lines (15-16) have been deleted, leaving them only partly legible. They\n                     may read (with Erdman page 850n), \"How many Blackamoors / Coud sing with their\n                     thick lips\". Blake may have originally started line 15 with \"If\" before\n                     changing to \"How\" (Erdman page 850n). Bentley reads line 15 less confidently:\n                        \"If(?) we(?) manage(?)\n                     Blackamoors\" (Writings volume 2, page 898). And there is\n                     considerable uncertainty in the reading of the first word of line 16, which may\n                     be \"Will\" (Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 898), \"Coud\"\n                     (Erdman page 850n), or \"cant\" (Phillips page 59). Bentley reads the opening word of the line as \"thus\" (Writings volume 2, page 899). Phillips reads the deleted word(s) following \"other\" as \"sheet a\" (page 60).\n                     Bentley notes only \"word del\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 899), while Erdman does not note the deletion. Bentley reads \"Sicknackers\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899), Phillips \"Sicknakers\" (page 60). Between \"people\" and \"who\" is a stroke \u00e2\u0080\u0094 probably a false start\n                     \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that Phillips reads as a short dash (page 60). \"abilies\": i.e., presumably, a slip for \"abilities\".\n                     Bentley reads \"abilies\" as \"abities\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899).  \"yo\": i.e.,\n                     presumably, a slip for \"you\". The illegible letters and \"William Blake\" have been\n                  smudged. All of the text in this line has\n                     been smudged. The \"N\" has been\n                     smudged. The gap indicates a partial letter. It may be the backstroke for a capital\n                     letter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 perhaps \"B\". At the beginning of the line\n                     are two partial letters. The first may be a partial capital \"T\" or \"F\". The\n                     second is a small partial stroke. The second legible \"n\" has been\n                     smudged. The text has been smudged. The \"m\" has been smudged. The words \"William Blake\" appear to\n                     have been cancelled.  \"Lamb\", written in a very small hand, is\n                     almost obscured by the first large \"n\". The second \"n\" has been lightly\n                     smudged. The illegible text at the end of the line appears to be a partial\n                     letter\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps \"c\" or \"o\". The illegible text could be the capital letter \"L\" or simply a\n                     squiggle. The letters \"Bl\" (followed by an uncertain letter \"a\") are written in\n                     backwards lettering. They are also smudged. The\n                     text has been smudged, and is written vertically in the lower right quadrant of\n                     the page. The blank verso of this leaf, designated as page B in Bentley and showing a\n                  considerable amount of show-through of the writing on this recto, is not\n                  reproduced here. Two or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time\n                  prior to 1905, between leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). Refer to\n                  the Work Information for more details about the manuscript. A diagonal pencil\n                  inscription at the bottom of the page, not in Blake's hand, reads, \"a leaf is\n                  evidently missing before this one\". At least some of the sketches and lettering on the verso (reproduced here) may\n                  conceivably be the product of both William Blake and his youngest brother Robert\n                  (1762-87). The awkwardness and redundancy of some of the work, the bare geometry\n                  of the head of the large lion(?) in the lower pair of animals in the upper left\n                  quadrant of the page, and the heavy overdrawing on some of the other animals are\n                  among the features that may possibly reflect Robert's attempts to draw subjects\n                  that had been set as exercises for him by older brother William, and, in some\n                  instances, corrected by one of them.The blank recto, designated as page O in Bentley, and showing a considerable\n                  amount of show-through from the ink lines on this verso, is not reproduced\n                  here.",

        "notes": "Bentley designates these as pages 1-16, A, P. Not included here,\n                  among the 18 objects, are the blank verso of object 17 (Bentley page B) and the\n                  blank recto of object 18 (Bentley page O). We are also not including Bentley pages\n                  C-N, all blanks, which are now housed separately from the leaves bearing the\n                  manuscript. Each leaf was originally half of a folio (2 conjugate leaves). Two\n                  or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time prior to 1905, between\n                  leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). The verso of leaf 9 (page B in\n                  Bentley) and the recto of what is now leaf 10 (formerly leaf 16, page O in\n                  Bentley) are blank. These blank pages are not reproduced here. Before rebinding in\n                  1978, there were 6 blank leaves (Bentley pages C-N) of the same paper that bears\n                  the manuscript between what are now leaves 9 and 10 (objects 17-18 as numbered\n                  here). As the sequence of watermarks and countermarks indicates, these blank\n                  leaves were once conjugate with the manuscript. The verso of the final leaf\n                  (object 18 as numbered here and page P in Bentley) bears assorted drawings and\n                  inscriptions. It is included in Butlin's catalogue (no. 149) as \"The Lamb Lying\n                  Down with the Lion and Other Drawings, from 'An Island in the Moon' Manuscript.\"\n                      The watermark appears on leaves 2-8, 10 (objects 3-16, 18 as numbered\n                  here). A countermark, consisting of the letters \"G R\" under a crown, appears on\n                  leaves 1 and 9 (objects 1-2, 17 as numbered here). Object 3 is numbered both 1 and 2 upper left and 5 upper right;\n                  object 5 is numbered 3 upper left and 6 upper right. Objects 7, 11, 13, and 15 are\n                  numbered 9, 6, 7, and 8 upper left. All these numbers are in pencil. They are\n                  probably not written by Blake and thus are not included in our\n                  transcriptions. Each manuscript leaf is mounted\n                  in a paper frame. The present binding was created in 1978; formerly bound in red\n                  morocco with each leaf attached to a stub. The former binding included a\n                  proofsheet of Blake's woodcuts for Robert John Thornton's Pastorals\n                     of Virgil (1821) and a note from A.H. Palmer referring to their\n                  provenance.  Early history not known. Acquired before 1893 by Charles Fairfax Murray; given by\n               Murray to the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1905. A Fitzwilliam Museum collection stamp\n               appears on the verso of the final leaf (object 18 here). Erdman reads the deletion as \"tipsy\" (page 449), Bentley as illegible\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 875), and Phillips as \"tipsy\n                     &\" (page 28). Blake may have first written \"endeavourd\" or \"endeavoured\" before altering\n                     the word to \"endeavouring\". Erdman (page 449) and Phillips (page 28) read \"imagination\" as\n                     \"imaginations\".  Various attempts have been made to\n                     decipher the illegible deletions in lines 24-25. The deletion in line 24\n                     appears to have been an inserted addition following \"Philosophers\" in line 25.\n                     Bentley reads the deletion as \"Quid\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876); Phillips as \"the older\" (page 28); Erdman as \"Quid\" (deleted), replaced\n                     by \"the Older\", mended to \"the Elder\", deleted in turn (pages 450,\n                     849n). \"Inffammable\": i.e., \"Inflammable\" (corrected by Blake,\n                     according to Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 876). In line 32,\n                     the letters \"ee\" in \"see\" appear to have been struck through. A word in line 35, presumably intended for \"Antiquarian\", is\n                     partly covered by an ink spot. A word in line 36, presumably intended for\n                     \"along\", is partly covered by an ink spot. Phillips (page 28) and Erdman (page 450) read\n                     \"outr\u00c3\u00a9\", Bentley \"outr\u00c3\u00a8\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876).  In line 2, the deleted words are probably\n                     \"here the\" (Phillips page 31) preceded by a partially deleted em-dash, but\n                     Bentley reads the deletions as \"----- had the\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 876), Erdman as \"here Etr\" (page 450). In line 4, part of the the \"I\" in \"Inflammable\" has been cut\n                     away. Erdman emends \"staring\" to\n                     \"star[t]ing\" (page 450). \"Obuse\":\n                     i.e., presumably, \"Obtuse\". Erdman (mistakenly) reads an inserted \"said\" just after the deletion\n                     (page 450). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878) and Phillips (page\n                     32) read the deletion as \"and\"; Erdman (page 451) reads it as \"Miss\". Our\n                     reading of \"and\" is uncertain. Phillips reads \"Ma\" instead of \"M.rs\n                     Sigtagatist\" (32). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" instead of \"Sigtagatist\"\n                     throughout (Writings volume 2), but, as Erdman indicates,\n                     \"The name 'Sigtagatist' was first written 'Sistagatist' in most places, but\n                     mended\" (page 849n). In lines 3-7, it is possible that the women's names\n                     replace the deleted men's names, but this substitution is uncertain. Deleted at the end of the line is a phrase, \"All the three Philosophers\",\n                     followed by words that Bentley finds illegible (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878), Phillips reads as \"& very\" (page 32), and Erdman as\n                     \"and the three Philosophers com[in]g\" (page 849n). Our reading of these words\n                     (\"& very\") is uncertain.  In the deletion, Erdman reads \"& Suction\" (page 849n). In the deletion, Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878)\n                     and Erdman (page 849n) omit the \"&\". \"Gibble Gabble the wife of Inflammable\n                     Gass __\" may be part of a larger replacement of women's names for the deleted\n                     men's names in lines 4-6. In the deletion, Phillips omits the \"&\" after \"room\"\n                     (page 32). \"Little Scopprell ... the room\" may be part of a larger replacement\n                     of women's names for the deleted men's names in lines 4-6. \"*Arse\" apparently replaced the deleted\n                     \"Ass\" before both words were deleted and replaced by \"ass_\" (added in light\n                     ink). Erdman, on the basis of the asterisk, restores \"Arse\", to read the line\n                     as \"call me *Arse--)\" (pages 451, 849n). The deletion \"an\" is not noted by Bentley and Erdman. Bentley reads \"would\" as \"wants\" (Writings volume\n                     2, page 878). Bentley reads \"laught\" as \"laughd\" (Writings volume 2, page 878). Bentley reads the\n                     deleted word as \"Comparative(?)\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878). For \"answerd\" (line 31), Erdman reads\n                     \"?exclaimed\" (page 849n). Phillips reads the illegible deletion as \"Miss\"\n                     (page 32); Erdman describes it as a \"short illegible word ending in 'f'\" (page\n                     849n). Phillips reads the deleted phrase (in lines 39-40) as \"of / what you\n                     read\" (page 32), while Erdman reads \"of / what you st\" (page 452). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page 879) throughout. Blake has inserted a\n                     curly bracket that spans lines 10-11. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 880) throughout. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     880) throughout. Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and\n                     Erdman (page 453) read \"Mathematician\". \"why / I know that\" (spanning lines 16, 18) is deleted and then restored (in\n                     line 17) above the deletion and the underscore in line 18. Erdman reads the\n                     deletion as \"?obj Obtuse ?Angle\" (page 849n). The word \"whether\" may be \"whither\". Bentley reads the deletion (lines 31-32) as \"what is this gim(?) used for\" (Writings volume 2, page 849n). For\n                     \"Arsdology\" Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and Erdman\n                     (page 453) read \"Aridology\". Bentley reads \"Hagamy Hatomy\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 881). Erdman reads the deletion as \"Cha\" (page 451) and\n                     Phillips as \"the\" (page 36). Phillips reads the deletion as\n                     \"tw--\" (page 39) and Erdman as \"twen[ty]\" (page 454). Phillips reads the deletion as \"a-\" (page 39). There is a redundant stroke in the first \"p\" of\n                     \"Sipsop\". The deletion (\"bl\") is not noted by Bentley and\n                     Erdman. The heavily deleted words at the end of the line are illegible except for\n                     \"This is\" at the beginning and a lowercase \"f\" midway. Bentley ventures to\n                     decipher \"This is\" (Writings volume 2, page 885); Erdman,\n                     more aggressively, ventures \"This is unfair and ?I ?think\" (page 456). The ink used to delete this line is lighter than the original ink. The illegible deletion is not noted by Erdman. The last word of the line is\n                     \"as\", though Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 885) and Erdman\n                     (page 456) read \"a\" without comment. \"Sopprell\": i.e., presumably, a slip for\n                     \"Scopprell\". \"Gent\" is written over an obscured word\n                     ending in \"man\", deleted by wash. Erdman (page 848) and Phillips (page 43) read\n                     the deleted word at the end of the line as \"Gentleman\". The word \"about\" (an uncertain reading)\n                     is written over text that cannot be recovered. Bentley makes out \"three words del\" (Writings volume 2, page 886),\n                     while Erdman reads \"its a book about\" (page 456). Phillips renders the phrase\n                     as we do here, though he speculates further that the \"first reading may have\n                     been 'Steelyard then' written in light brown ink, evidently the same ink used\n                     to write the first reading 'Gentleman' immediately above. 'Steelyard then' was\n                     then deleted with a full nib in a series of flourishes ending in 'about'\" (page\n                     83n). With this line, Blake shifts to using a lighter\n                     ink. Bentley\n                     reads \"coach\" (Writings volume 2, page 886) instead of\n                     \"coaches\". Phillips reads the final word as \"ride\" but indicates that this reading is\n                     \"conjectured\" (pages 44, 84). Erdman and Bentley see only a three-word\n                     deletion: \"he does not\". Erdman omits the initial ampersand altogether (page\n                     457). Bentley leaves it standing, undeleted (Writings volume\n                     2, page 887). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 887) and Erdman (page 457) both read the last\n                     word of the deletion as \"Envying\". \"kins\" in \"lambkins\" is written over \"s\n                     do\" in \"lambs do\". Bentley reads \"that\" for \"That\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     888). For \"pritty\" Bentley reads \"pretty\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 889). In lines 29 and 31, \"about London / O no\" is legible but deleted \"by\n                     washing out\" (Phillips page 88n). Phillips reads this line\n                     as \"My\", \"written in very pale brown ink\", above \"Nannicantipot\" (pages 47,\n                     88n). But it seems rather to be \"tty\", mirroring the letters just above, in\n                     \"pritty\", and partly erased. In line 31, \"about Matches\" could be replacing the\n                     deleted \"O no\" in the same line and/or the deleted \"about London\" in line\n                     29. \"When\" is washed out but clearly legible above \"Then\", which replaces\n                     it. Erdman reads\n                     the deleted \"sweet\" as \"sweeter\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"?one\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"ll\" (page\n                     459); Bentley does not note the deletion. An erased \"f\", clearly visible before\n                     \"cock\", is the most visible remains of what may be \"This frog\", which was\n                     erased and overwritten with \"Sing co\" in \"Sing cock\" (Erdman page 849n,\n                     Phillips page 90n). The descender of a corrected \"p\" remains\n                     in the middle of \"Sipsop\". Bentley reads \"Sung\" for \"sung\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 891). An illegible\n                     letter or other mark may be deleted between \"Hail\" and \"fingerfooted\". Phillips\n                     reads this as an (undeleted) short dash, \"Hail - fingerfooted\" (page 48).\n                     Bentley and Erdman do not note it. Bentley reads \"widow\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"maidens\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"matrimony\" for \"Matrimony\" and \"how\" for \"How\" (Writings volume 2, page 892).  Erdman reads \"Cynic\" for \"cynic\" (page 460). For \"allways,\" Erdman (page 460) and Phillips (page 51) read\n                     \"always\". The word \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40). In the next line, the letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" are\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41), thus reversing the original order of those\n                     words.  The letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" is\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41). In the previous line, \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40), thus reversing the original order of those\n                  words. The \"s\" at\n                     the end of \"laws\" is made unclear by what may be a spot of ink. Erdman maintains that \"jet\" is \"mended from git\"\n                     (page 850n; also Phillips page 92n). Bentley reads \"give\" for \"gave\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 894). The horizontal line terminates in an area of wash. Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52) read\n                     \"foolish.--\". Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 894) and Erdman (page\n                     462) omit the period after \"louse\". Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52)\n                     read the deleted word at the end of the line, which begins with a legible \"cl\"\n                     and has been both struck through and erased, as \"climing\" (that is,\n                     climbing). Phillips reads a period\n                     after the comma (page 52). Bentley reads \"slides\"\n                     instead of \"sliders\" (Writings volume 2, page 894). Erdman reads a period after the dash (page 462). Erdman reads the deleted \"he\" after \"room.\", less probably, as \"Go\" (page\n                     462). Bentley reads the deletions that begin at the end of line 1 as \"you are\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 895), Erdman as \"you / ar\" (page\n                     462), Phillips as \"gas / --\" (page 55). Beyond the descender on the first word,\n                     the deletions are illegible and the readings speculative. This is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched with\n                     designs, became \"Holy Thursday\" in Songs of Innocence, 1789\n                     (Bentley plate 19). For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 18-20. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     93-94n). This line was probably written in the break between the original stanzas 2\n                     and 3 as a replacement for the final line of stanza 2 (line 21) after Blake had\n                     deleted it. A four-line stanza (lines 23-26) has been\n                     deleted. After it was deleted, the second couplet (lines 25-26) was not reused;\n                     the first couplet (lines 23-24) was rewritten and used to introduce the revised\n                     stanza below (lines 27-30). This unrhymed line is unique in a poem otherwise\n                     written in couplets. Erdman reads \"Cherubim & Seraphim\" (page 850n). Lines 28-31 make up the revised stanza that\n                     replaces the deleted four-line stanza (lines 23-26) and the unrhymed verse that\n                     follows (line 27). A second lowercase \"g\" is written over the original \"g\" in \"among\", perhaps\n                     to strengthen it.  Bentley reads the deletion as \"Mrs Sistagatist\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 896). Bentley reads the deletion as \"Grand\" (Writings volume 2, page 896). \"The voice\" is washed out. These lines\n                     (35-44) make up the opening two stanzas of the earliest known draft of the poem\n                     that, etched with designs, became \"Nurse's Song\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 24). The poem continues on the next page\n                     of the manuscript. For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 94-95n. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     94-95n). The spacing and\n                     lettering suggest that the line originally began \"The tongues\". Blake then\n                     inserted \"When\" before \"The\" and altered \"The\" to \"the\" to read \"When the\n                     tongues\". These two stanzas (lines 1-11) complete the draft of \"Nurse's Song\"\n                     that begins on the previous page (14.35-44). Erdman outlines the sequence of revisions thus: Blake originally wrote\n                     \"cannot go to sleep\", emended it to \"cannot sleep till its dark\", and then\n                     restored the original \"cannot go to sleep\" (page 850n). Phillips describes a\n                     similar sequence, but notes that the original \"go to\" was overwritten by \"get\n                     to\" and \"till its dark\" was added to the line (to read \"and we cannot get to\n                     sleep till its dark\"). Phillips claims that Blake then restored the original\n                     \"go to\" by a supralinear insertion and deleted \"till its dark\" (page 95n). See\n                     note for line 4 for additional information about Blake's revisions to these\n                     lines. Phillips gives a plausible account of the revisions in lines 2-4 that hinges\n                     on the notion that Blake, \"momentarily forgetting the rhyme scheme [abcb]\n                     established in the first stanzas on the preceding page\", wrote line 4, made\n                     some adjustments in lines 2-3, and then recognizing \"his mistake ... restored\n                     the original reading\" of line 3, deleted line 4, and then \"went on to write the\n                     next two lines\" in conformity with the original rhyme scheme (page 95n). Erdman reads a lowercase initial \"s\" in the undeleted \"Sung Quid\" at the end\n                     of the line (page 463). This (lines 13-20) is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched\n                     with designs, became \"The Little Boy lost\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 13). Phillips prints a version of the\n                     poem that displays the differences between this and the etched version (page\n                     96). The word \"turd\" is deleted and replaced by \"tansey\", written in\n                     lighter ink. Erdman reads the beginning of the deletion as \"To hit me\" (page\n                     850n). Erdman reads \"a[ny bird the\"\n                     (page 850n); Bentley \"[\u00e2\u0080\u0083 \u00e2\u0080\u0083d he del]\" (Writings volume 2, page 897); Phillips \"an old\n                        he (page 56). Phillips reads \"began-\" (page 56). The phrase \"leave to\" is presumably a slip for\n                     \"leave me to\". \"O\" is written over \"l\" (probably the start of \"leave\",\n                     conjectures Erdman, page 850n). Two lines (15-16) have been deleted, leaving them only partly legible. They\n                     may read (with Erdman page 850n), \"How many Blackamoors / Coud sing with their\n                     thick lips\". Blake may have originally started line 15 with \"If\" before\n                     changing to \"How\" (Erdman page 850n). Bentley reads line 15 less confidently:\n                        \"If(?) we(?) manage(?)\n                     Blackamoors\" (Writings volume 2, page 898). And there is\n                     considerable uncertainty in the reading of the first word of line 16, which may\n                     be \"Will\" (Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 898), \"Coud\"\n                     (Erdman page 850n), or \"cant\" (Phillips page 59). Bentley reads the opening word of the line as \"thus\" (Writings volume 2, page 899). Phillips reads the deleted word(s) following \"other\" as \"sheet a\" (page 60).\n                     Bentley notes only \"word del\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 899), while Erdman does not note the deletion. Bentley reads \"Sicknackers\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899), Phillips \"Sicknakers\" (page 60). Between \"people\" and \"who\" is a stroke \u00e2\u0080\u0094 probably a false start\n                     \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that Phillips reads as a short dash (page 60). \"abilies\": i.e., presumably, a slip for \"abilities\".\n                     Bentley reads \"abilies\" as \"abities\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899).  \"yo\": i.e.,\n                     presumably, a slip for \"you\". The illegible letters and \"William Blake\" have been\n                  smudged. All of the text in this line has\n                     been smudged. The \"N\" has been\n                     smudged. The gap indicates a partial letter. It may be the backstroke for a capital\n                     letter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 perhaps \"B\". At the beginning of the line\n                     are two partial letters. The first may be a partial capital \"T\" or \"F\". The\n                     second is a small partial stroke. The second legible \"n\" has been\n                     smudged. The text has been smudged. The \"m\" has been smudged. The words \"William Blake\" appear to\n                     have been cancelled.  \"Lamb\", written in a very small hand, is\n                     almost obscured by the first large \"n\". The second \"n\" has been lightly\n                     smudged. The illegible text at the end of the line appears to be a partial\n                     letter\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps \"c\" or \"o\". The illegible text could be the capital letter \"L\" or simply a\n                     squiggle. The letters \"Bl\" (followed by an uncertain letter \"a\") are written in\n                     backwards lettering. They are also smudged. The\n                     text has been smudged, and is written vertically in the lower right quadrant of\n                     the page. The blank verso of this leaf, designated as page B in Bentley and showing a\n                  considerable amount of show-through of the writing on this recto, is not\n                  reproduced here. Two or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time\n                  prior to 1905, between leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). Refer to\n                  the Work Information for more details about the manuscript. A diagonal pencil\n                  inscription at the bottom of the page, not in Blake's hand, reads, \"a leaf is\n                  evidently missing before this one\". At least some of the sketches and lettering on the verso (reproduced here) may\n                  conceivably be the product of both William Blake and his youngest brother Robert\n                  (1762-87). The awkwardness and redundancy of some of the work, the bare geometry\n                  of the head of the large lion(?) in the lower pair of animals in the upper left\n                  quadrant of the page, and the heavy overdrawing on some of the other animals are\n                  among the features that may possibly reflect Robert's attempts to draw subjects\n                  that had been set as exercises for him by older brother William, and, in some\n                  instances, corrected by one of them.The blank recto, designated as page O in Bentley, and showing a considerable\n                  amount of show-through from the ink lines on this verso, is not reproduced\n                  here.",

        "notes": "Bentley designates these as pages 1-16, A, P. Not included here,\n                  among the 18 objects, are the blank verso of object 17 (Bentley page B) and the\n                  blank recto of object 18 (Bentley page O). We are also not including Bentley pages\n                  C-N, all blanks, which are now housed separately from the leaves bearing the\n                  manuscript. Each leaf was originally half of a folio (2 conjugate leaves). Two\n                  or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time prior to 1905, between\n                  leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). The verso of leaf 9 (page B in\n                  Bentley) and the recto of what is now leaf 10 (formerly leaf 16, page O in\n                  Bentley) are blank. These blank pages are not reproduced here. Before rebinding in\n                  1978, there were 6 blank leaves (Bentley pages C-N) of the same paper that bears\n                  the manuscript between what are now leaves 9 and 10 (objects 17-18 as numbered\n                  here). As the sequence of watermarks and countermarks indicates, these blank\n                  leaves were once conjugate with the manuscript. The verso of the final leaf\n                  (object 18 as numbered here and page P in Bentley) bears assorted drawings and\n                  inscriptions. It is included in Butlin's catalogue (no. 149) as \"The Lamb Lying\n                  Down with the Lion and Other Drawings, from 'An Island in the Moon' Manuscript.\"\n                      The watermark appears on leaves 2-8, 10 (objects 3-16, 18 as numbered\n                  here). A countermark, consisting of the letters \"G R\" under a crown, appears on\n                  leaves 1 and 9 (objects 1-2, 17 as numbered here). Object 3 is numbered both 1 and 2 upper left and 5 upper right;\n                  object 5 is numbered 3 upper left and 6 upper right. Objects 7, 11, 13, and 15 are\n                  numbered 9, 6, 7, and 8 upper left. All these numbers are in pencil. They are\n                  probably not written by Blake and thus are not included in our\n                  transcriptions. Each manuscript leaf is mounted\n                  in a paper frame. The present binding was created in 1978; formerly bound in red\n                  morocco with each leaf attached to a stub. The former binding included a\n                  proofsheet of Blake's woodcuts for Robert John Thornton's Pastorals\n                     of Virgil (1821) and a note from A.H. Palmer referring to their\n                  provenance.  Early history not known. Acquired before 1893 by Charles Fairfax Murray; given by\n               Murray to the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1905. A Fitzwilliam Museum collection stamp\n               appears on the verso of the final leaf (object 18 here). Erdman reads the deletion as \"tipsy\" (page 449), Bentley as illegible\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 875), and Phillips as \"tipsy\n                     &\" (page 28). Blake may have first written \"endeavourd\" or \"endeavoured\" before altering\n                     the word to \"endeavouring\". Erdman (page 449) and Phillips (page 28) read \"imagination\" as\n                     \"imaginations\".  Various attempts have been made to\n                     decipher the illegible deletions in lines 24-25. The deletion in line 24\n                     appears to have been an inserted addition following \"Philosophers\" in line 25.\n                     Bentley reads the deletion as \"Quid\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876); Phillips as \"the older\" (page 28); Erdman as \"Quid\" (deleted), replaced\n                     by \"the Older\", mended to \"the Elder\", deleted in turn (pages 450,\n                     849n). \"Inffammable\": i.e., \"Inflammable\" (corrected by Blake,\n                     according to Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 876). In line 32,\n                     the letters \"ee\" in \"see\" appear to have been struck through. A word in line 35, presumably intended for \"Antiquarian\", is\n                     partly covered by an ink spot. A word in line 36, presumably intended for\n                     \"along\", is partly covered by an ink spot. Phillips (page 28) and Erdman (page 450) read\n                     \"outr\u00c3\u00a9\", Bentley \"outr\u00c3\u00a8\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     876).  In line 2, the deleted words are probably\n                     \"here the\" (Phillips page 31) preceded by a partially deleted em-dash, but\n                     Bentley reads the deletions as \"----- had the\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 876), Erdman as \"here Etr\" (page 450). In line 4, part of the the \"I\" in \"Inflammable\" has been cut\n                     away. Erdman emends \"staring\" to\n                     \"star[t]ing\" (page 450). \"Obuse\":\n                     i.e., presumably, \"Obtuse\". Erdman (mistakenly) reads an inserted \"said\" just after the deletion\n                     (page 450). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878) and Phillips (page\n                     32) read the deletion as \"and\"; Erdman (page 451) reads it as \"Miss\". Our\n                     reading of \"and\" is uncertain. Phillips reads \"Ma\" instead of \"M.rs\n                     Sigtagatist\" (32). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" instead of \"Sigtagatist\"\n                     throughout (Writings volume 2), but, as Erdman indicates,\n                     \"The name 'Sigtagatist' was first written 'Sistagatist' in most places, but\n                     mended\" (page 849n). In lines 3-7, it is possible that the women's names\n                     replace the deleted men's names, but this substitution is uncertain. Deleted at the end of the line is a phrase, \"All the three Philosophers\",\n                     followed by words that Bentley finds illegible (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878), Phillips reads as \"& very\" (page 32), and Erdman as\n                     \"and the three Philosophers com[in]g\" (page 849n). Our reading of these words\n                     (\"& very\") is uncertain.  In the deletion, Erdman reads \"& Suction\" (page 849n). In the deletion, Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 878)\n                     and Erdman (page 849n) omit the \"&\". \"Gibble Gabble the wife of Inflammable\n                     Gass __\" may be part of a larger replacement of women's names for the deleted\n                     men's names in lines 4-6. In the deletion, Phillips omits the \"&\" after \"room\"\n                     (page 32). \"Little Scopprell ... the room\" may be part of a larger replacement\n                     of women's names for the deleted men's names in lines 4-6. \"*Arse\" apparently replaced the deleted\n                     \"Ass\" before both words were deleted and replaced by \"ass_\" (added in light\n                     ink). Erdman, on the basis of the asterisk, restores \"Arse\", to read the line\n                     as \"call me *Arse--)\" (pages 451, 849n). The deletion \"an\" is not noted by Bentley and Erdman. Bentley reads \"would\" as \"wants\" (Writings volume\n                     2, page 878). Bentley reads \"laught\" as \"laughd\" (Writings volume 2, page 878). Bentley reads the\n                     deleted word as \"Comparative(?)\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 878). For \"answerd\" (line 31), Erdman reads\n                     \"?exclaimed\" (page 849n). Phillips reads the illegible deletion as \"Miss\"\n                     (page 32); Erdman describes it as a \"short illegible word ending in 'f'\" (page\n                     849n). Phillips reads the deleted phrase (in lines 39-40) as \"of / what you\n                     read\" (page 32), while Erdman reads \"of / what you st\" (page 452). Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page 879) throughout. Blake has inserted a\n                     curly bracket that spans lines 10-11. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 880) throughout. Bentley reads \"Sistagatist\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     880) throughout. Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and\n                     Erdman (page 453) read \"Mathematician\". \"why / I know that\" (spanning lines 16, 18) is deleted and then restored (in\n                     line 17) above the deletion and the underscore in line 18. Erdman reads the\n                     deletion as \"?obj Obtuse ?Angle\" (page 849n). The word \"whether\" may be \"whither\". Bentley reads the deletion (lines 31-32) as \"what is this gim(?) used for\" (Writings volume 2, page 849n). For\n                     \"Arsdology\" Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 881) and Erdman\n                     (page 453) read \"Aridology\". Bentley reads \"Hagamy Hatomy\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 881). Erdman reads the deletion as \"Cha\" (page 451) and\n                     Phillips as \"the\" (page 36). Phillips reads the deletion as\n                     \"tw--\" (page 39) and Erdman as \"twen[ty]\" (page 454). Phillips reads the deletion as \"a-\" (page 39). There is a redundant stroke in the first \"p\" of\n                     \"Sipsop\". The deletion (\"bl\") is not noted by Bentley and\n                     Erdman. The heavily deleted words at the end of the line are illegible except for\n                     \"This is\" at the beginning and a lowercase \"f\" midway. Bentley ventures to\n                     decipher \"This is\" (Writings volume 2, page 885); Erdman,\n                     more aggressively, ventures \"This is unfair and ?I ?think\" (page 456). The ink used to delete this line is lighter than the original ink. The illegible deletion is not noted by Erdman. The last word of the line is\n                     \"as\", though Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 885) and Erdman\n                     (page 456) read \"a\" without comment. \"Sopprell\": i.e., presumably, a slip for\n                     \"Scopprell\". \"Gent\" is written over an obscured word\n                     ending in \"man\", deleted by wash. Erdman (page 848) and Phillips (page 43) read\n                     the deleted word at the end of the line as \"Gentleman\". The word \"about\" (an uncertain reading)\n                     is written over text that cannot be recovered. Bentley makes out \"three words del\" (Writings volume 2, page 886),\n                     while Erdman reads \"its a book about\" (page 456). Phillips renders the phrase\n                     as we do here, though he speculates further that the \"first reading may have\n                     been 'Steelyard then' written in light brown ink, evidently the same ink used\n                     to write the first reading 'Gentleman' immediately above. 'Steelyard then' was\n                     then deleted with a full nib in a series of flourishes ending in 'about'\" (page\n                     83n). With this line, Blake shifts to using a lighter\n                     ink. Bentley\n                     reads \"coach\" (Writings volume 2, page 886) instead of\n                     \"coaches\". Phillips reads the final word as \"ride\" but indicates that this reading is\n                     \"conjectured\" (pages 44, 84). Erdman and Bentley see only a three-word\n                     deletion: \"he does not\". Erdman omits the initial ampersand altogether (page\n                     457). Bentley leaves it standing, undeleted (Writings volume\n                     2, page 887). Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 887) and Erdman (page 457) both read the last\n                     word of the deletion as \"Envying\". \"kins\" in \"lambkins\" is written over \"s\n                     do\" in \"lambs do\". Bentley reads \"that\" for \"That\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     888). For \"pritty\" Bentley reads \"pretty\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 889). In lines 29 and 31, \"about London / O no\" is legible but deleted \"by\n                     washing out\" (Phillips page 88n). Phillips reads this line\n                     as \"My\", \"written in very pale brown ink\", above \"Nannicantipot\" (pages 47,\n                     88n). But it seems rather to be \"tty\", mirroring the letters just above, in\n                     \"pritty\", and partly erased. In line 31, \"about Matches\" could be replacing the\n                     deleted \"O no\" in the same line and/or the deleted \"about London\" in line\n                     29. \"When\" is washed out but clearly legible above \"Then\", which replaces\n                     it. Erdman reads\n                     the deleted \"sweet\" as \"sweeter\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"?one\" (page 459). Erdman reads the deletion as \"ll\" (page\n                     459); Bentley does not note the deletion. An erased \"f\", clearly visible before\n                     \"cock\", is the most visible remains of what may be \"This frog\", which was\n                     erased and overwritten with \"Sing co\" in \"Sing cock\" (Erdman page 849n,\n                     Phillips page 90n). The descender of a corrected \"p\" remains\n                     in the middle of \"Sipsop\". Bentley reads \"Sung\" for \"sung\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 891). An illegible\n                     letter or other mark may be deleted between \"Hail\" and \"fingerfooted\". Phillips\n                     reads this as an (undeleted) short dash, \"Hail - fingerfooted\" (page 48).\n                     Bentley and Erdman do not note it. Bentley reads \"widow\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"maidens\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     892). Bentley reads \"matrimony\" for \"Matrimony\" and \"how\" for \"How\" (Writings volume 2, page 892).  Erdman reads \"Cynic\" for \"cynic\" (page 460). For \"allways,\" Erdman (page 460) and Phillips (page 51) read\n                     \"always\". The word \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40). In the next line, the letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" are\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41), thus reversing the original order of those\n                     words.  The letters \"wi\" in \"windows\" is\n                     written over \"chi\" (line 41). In the previous line, \"chimneys\" is written over\n                     \"windows\" (line 40), thus reversing the original order of those\n                  words. The \"s\" at\n                     the end of \"laws\" is made unclear by what may be a spot of ink. Erdman maintains that \"jet\" is \"mended from git\"\n                     (page 850n; also Phillips page 92n). Bentley reads \"give\" for \"gave\" (Writings volume 2,\n                     page 894). The horizontal line terminates in an area of wash. Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52) read\n                     \"foolish.--\". Bentley (Writings volume 2, page 894) and Erdman (page\n                     462) omit the period after \"louse\". Erdman (page 462) and Phillips (page 52)\n                     read the deleted word at the end of the line, which begins with a legible \"cl\"\n                     and has been both struck through and erased, as \"climing\" (that is,\n                     climbing). Phillips reads a period\n                     after the comma (page 52). Bentley reads \"slides\"\n                     instead of \"sliders\" (Writings volume 2, page 894). Erdman reads a period after the dash (page 462). Erdman reads the deleted \"he\" after \"room.\", less probably, as \"Go\" (page\n                     462). Bentley reads the deletions that begin at the end of line 1 as \"you are\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 895), Erdman as \"you / ar\" (page\n                     462), Phillips as \"gas / --\" (page 55). Beyond the descender on the first word,\n                     the deletions are illegible and the readings speculative. This is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched with\n                     designs, became \"Holy Thursday\" in Songs of Innocence, 1789\n                     (Bentley plate 19). For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 18-20. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     93-94n). This line was probably written in the break between the original stanzas 2\n                     and 3 as a replacement for the final line of stanza 2 (line 21) after Blake had\n                     deleted it. A four-line stanza (lines 23-26) has been\n                     deleted. After it was deleted, the second couplet (lines 25-26) was not reused;\n                     the first couplet (lines 23-24) was rewritten and used to introduce the revised\n                     stanza below (lines 27-30). This unrhymed line is unique in a poem otherwise\n                     written in couplets. Erdman reads \"Cherubim & Seraphim\" (page 850n). Lines 28-31 make up the revised stanza that\n                     replaces the deleted four-line stanza (lines 23-26) and the unrhymed verse that\n                     follows (line 27). A second lowercase \"g\" is written over the original \"g\" in \"among\", perhaps\n                     to strengthen it.  Bentley reads the deletion as \"Mrs Sistagatist\"\n                        (Writings volume 2, page 896). Bentley reads the deletion as \"Grand\" (Writings volume 2, page 896). \"The voice\" is washed out. These lines\n                     (35-44) make up the opening two stanzas of the earliest known draft of the poem\n                     that, etched with designs, became \"Nurse's Song\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 24). The poem continues on the next page\n                     of the manuscript. For accounts of the stages of composition, see Erdman page\n                     850n and Phillips pages 94-95n. Phillips prints a version of the poem that\n                     displays the differences between this and the etched version (pages\n                     94-95n). The spacing and\n                     lettering suggest that the line originally began \"The tongues\". Blake then\n                     inserted \"When\" before \"The\" and altered \"The\" to \"the\" to read \"When the\n                     tongues\". These two stanzas (lines 1-11) complete the draft of \"Nurse's Song\"\n                     that begins on the previous page (14.35-44). Erdman outlines the sequence of revisions thus: Blake originally wrote\n                     \"cannot go to sleep\", emended it to \"cannot sleep till its dark\", and then\n                     restored the original \"cannot go to sleep\" (page 850n). Phillips describes a\n                     similar sequence, but notes that the original \"go to\" was overwritten by \"get\n                     to\" and \"till its dark\" was added to the line (to read \"and we cannot get to\n                     sleep till its dark\"). Phillips claims that Blake then restored the original\n                     \"go to\" by a supralinear insertion and deleted \"till its dark\" (page 95n). See\n                     note for line 4 for additional information about Blake's revisions to these\n                     lines. Phillips gives a plausible account of the revisions in lines 2-4 that hinges\n                     on the notion that Blake, \"momentarily forgetting the rhyme scheme [abcb]\n                     established in the first stanzas on the preceding page\", wrote line 4, made\n                     some adjustments in lines 2-3, and then recognizing \"his mistake ... restored\n                     the original reading\" of line 3, deleted line 4, and then \"went on to write the\n                     next two lines\" in conformity with the original rhyme scheme (page 95n). Erdman reads a lowercase initial \"s\" in the undeleted \"Sung Quid\" at the end\n                     of the line (page 463). This (lines 13-20) is the earliest known draft of the poem that, etched\n                     with designs, became \"The Little Boy lost\" in Songs of\n                        Innocence, 1789 (Bentley plate 13). Phillips prints a version of the\n                     poem that displays the differences between this and the etched version (page\n                     96). The word \"turd\" is deleted and replaced by \"tansey\", written in\n                     lighter ink. Erdman reads the beginning of the deletion as \"To hit me\" (page\n                     850n). Erdman reads \"a[ny bird the\"\n                     (page 850n); Bentley \"[\u00e2\u0080\u0083 \u00e2\u0080\u0083d he del]\" (Writings volume 2, page 897); Phillips \"an old\n                        he (page 56). Phillips reads \"began-\" (page 56). The phrase \"leave to\" is presumably a slip for\n                     \"leave me to\". \"O\" is written over \"l\" (probably the start of \"leave\",\n                     conjectures Erdman, page 850n). Two lines (15-16) have been deleted, leaving them only partly legible. They\n                     may read (with Erdman page 850n), \"How many Blackamoors / Coud sing with their\n                     thick lips\". Blake may have originally started line 15 with \"If\" before\n                     changing to \"How\" (Erdman page 850n). Bentley reads line 15 less confidently:\n                        \"If(?) we(?) manage(?)\n                     Blackamoors\" (Writings volume 2, page 898). And there is\n                     considerable uncertainty in the reading of the first word of line 16, which may\n                     be \"Will\" (Bentley, Writings volume 2, page 898), \"Coud\"\n                     (Erdman page 850n), or \"cant\" (Phillips page 59). Bentley reads the opening word of the line as \"thus\" (Writings volume 2, page 899). Phillips reads the deleted word(s) following \"other\" as \"sheet a\" (page 60).\n                     Bentley notes only \"word del\" (Writings\n                     volume 2, page 899), while Erdman does not note the deletion. Bentley reads \"Sicknackers\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899), Phillips \"Sicknakers\" (page 60). Between \"people\" and \"who\" is a stroke \u00e2\u0080\u0094 probably a false start\n                     \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that Phillips reads as a short dash (page 60). \"abilies\": i.e., presumably, a slip for \"abilities\".\n                     Bentley reads \"abilies\" as \"abities\" (Writings volume 2, page\n                     899).  \"yo\": i.e.,\n                     presumably, a slip for \"you\". The illegible letters and \"William Blake\" have been\n                  smudged. All of the text in this line has\n                     been smudged. The \"N\" has been\n                     smudged. The gap indicates a partial letter. It may be the backstroke for a capital\n                     letter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 perhaps \"B\". At the beginning of the line\n                     are two partial letters. The first may be a partial capital \"T\" or \"F\". The\n                     second is a small partial stroke. The second legible \"n\" has been\n                     smudged. The text has been smudged. The \"m\" has been smudged. The words \"William Blake\" appear to\n                     have been cancelled.  \"Lamb\", written in a very small hand, is\n                     almost obscured by the first large \"n\". The second \"n\" has been lightly\n                     smudged. The illegible text at the end of the line appears to be a partial\n                     letter\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps \"c\" or \"o\". The illegible text could be the capital letter \"L\" or simply a\n                     squiggle. The letters \"Bl\" (followed by an uncertain letter \"a\") are written in\n                     backwards lettering. They are also smudged. The\n                     text has been smudged, and is written vertically in the lower right quadrant of\n                     the page. The blank verso of this leaf, designated as page B in Bentley and showing a\n                  considerable amount of show-through of the writing on this recto, is not\n                  reproduced here. Two or more leaves may have been removed, at an unknown time\n                  prior to 1905, between leaves 8 and 9 (objects 16-17 as numbered here). Refer to\n                  the Work Information for more details about the manuscript. A diagonal pencil\n                  inscription at the bottom of the page, not in Blake's hand, reads, \"a leaf is\n                  evidently missing before this one\". At least some of the sketches and lettering on the verso (reproduced here) may\n                  conceivably be the product of both William Blake and his youngest brother Robert\n                  (1762-87). The awkwardness and redundancy of some of the work, the bare geometry\n                  of the head of the large lion(?) in the lower pair of animals in the upper left\n                  quadrant of the page, and the heavy overdrawing on some of the other animals are\n                  among the features that may possibly reflect Robert's attempts to draw subjects\n                  that had been set as exercises for him by older brother William, and, in some\n                  instances, corrected by one of them.The blank recto, designated as page O in Bentley, and showing a considerable\n                  amount of show-through from the ink lines on this verso, is not reproduced\n                  here.",

            "illusobjdesc": "The page is covered by scattered bits of handwriting and sketches of\n                  several animals, a single bit of vegetation, and the profiles of two human faces.\n                  Fragments of formal script not obviously connected to the sketches appear to\n                  represent practice efforts at making various letters and letter sequences. In\n                  addition, the word \"Numeration\" appears, along with a few whole and partial\n                  signatures of William Blake. With one exception, the handwriting is located on the\n                  left three quarters of the page. For further information on the text, see the\n                  detailed transcriptions and editors' notes. Near the vertical midline of the page\n                  are two human faces in left profile, one above the other. A pair of animals\n                  recline near the top left corner. The larger animal may be a lion (with mane and\n                  tail), the smaller one possibly a young horse or sheep. Below that pair of animals\n                  lie a second pair in positions similar to the first \u2014 and with similar\n                  forms. Thus the larger is perhaps a lion and the smaller a young sheep or horse.\n                  The heads of the smaller animals in each of the two pairs seem similar to those in\n                  two, possibly three, other sketches on the page: one below and slightly to the\n                  right of the rear feet of the larger animal in the top pair, another to the right\n                  of the heavily outlined horse's head in the lower right quadrant. The third\n                  possibly related sketch is a left-facing sheep's(?) head in profile. It is located\n                  just to the right of the pair of animals in the top left corner, among lines that\n                  suggest clouds. There are elements of several horses \u2014 their bodies\n                  and heads in various positions but all facing left \u2014 sketched down the right\n                  side and across the bottom of the page. In addition to the six horses' heads and\n                  the partial bodies, there are several wavy horizontal lines, some (perhaps all) of\n                  which appear to be attempts at outlining aspects of the bodies of horses. In the\n                  upper right quadrant of the page, a left-facing horse, its head partly obscured by\n                  ink wash, rears on its hind legs. Between the extended front legs may be a small\n                  flower or leaf. To the right of the head and neck of the rearing horse are the\n                  profiles of a second and third horse's head, both facing left. Beneath the front\n                  shoulders of the rearing horse are a fourth and a fifth horse's head, both again\n                  in left profile. The fourth, nearest the rearing horse, is an obscure design\n                  suggesting the head of a horse with a prominent eye. Just below the fourth horse's\n                  head is a fifth. Two dark, curved lines extend to the right. The upper one may\n                  suggest the front shoulder, back, and rear end of this (or perhaps another, or\n                  perhaps no particular) horse. A lower line appears to extend from the bottom of\n                  that horse's neck to the right and down. Left of the vertical centerline of the\n                  page, near the bottom, to the left of the human face in profile, is a sixth\n                  horse's head. And in the bottom left corner of the page are the headless torso and\n                  hindquarters of a horse, facing left."

            "illusobjdesc": "An adult female (Mrs. Mason) and her two charges (Mary and Caroline) stand on a winding path to the left of a large tree.  \n               The tree has clearly visible roots, a large trunk, and leafy branches that arch to the left over the figures' heads.     \n               All three figures are gowned and wear hats.  Mrs. Mason is the rightmost figure in the group.  Her body faces right, but her head is \n               turned back to the left; she looks down towards the children.  Her right arm is down at her side while her left arm is bent upward and she \n               points or gestures above.  The child furthest to the left is seen in profile facing right.  Her long hair may be drawn back into a braid.  \n               Her right arm is bent; her left arm is not visible.  The middle figure also faces right and has long hair that falls onto her shoulders.  \n               She is bending slightly forward.  Her right arm is bent with the palm facing out, and her left arm is at her side with the palm facing down.  These gestures, and her slightly-opened mouth, suggest surprise.  \n               More distant trees (at least six in all) appear to the left and right of the group of figures.  Wash above the figures suggests a sky with \n               clouds.  Shadows extend from the feet of the figures to the right."
