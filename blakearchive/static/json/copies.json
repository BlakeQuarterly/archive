The second edition to contain Blake's plates was published by \\n            Johnson in 1796; it contains the third (final) states of Blake's plates. \\n            The copy of the 1791 edition now in the Archive is from the Huntington \\n            Library; it contains the second states of the plates.

Letters from this period track the downward spiral from the most hopeful moments of Blake\\u2019s anticipations of working for the beloved \\u201chermit of Eartham\\u201d to the bitterness and resentment he ultimately felt for that \\u201cpickthank.\\u201d The letters also show Blake in the process of conducting routine business: with Hayley but also with his important London patron Thomas Butts and with the publisher-promoter Robert Hartley Cromek, who was destined to become a focus of anger and frustration in the next stage of Blake\\u2019s life.  \\n                About ninety of Blake\\u2019s letters survive, an unknown fraction of the total. Several\\u2014ten in the present group of thirty-three\\u2014are known only from partial and full transcriptions in the second, expanded, edition of Alexander Gilchrist\\u2019s  (1880). Blake traveled seldom and not very far. His circle of correspondents was narrow and the geographical circuit small. But his modest body of correspondence comprises an absorbing, revealing miscellany of reports on work in progress alongside friendly and not so friendly exchanges on matters of practical and intellectual substance. Occasionally the letters burst out into visions that amalgamate, in a characteristic Blakean vein, homely details, intensely energized prose, and inspired poetry.\\u00a0    \\n                The letters are, in any case, indispensable in preserving facts and contexts for his life and work that would be otherwise unknown and in showing him shift pragmatically from role to role in a very natural\\u2014and human\\u2014way, exposing facets of character and personality not always so apparent in his art. The letters feel closer to the exigencies of everyday life than any other works from Blake\\u2019s hand. He seldom puts pen to paper without interesting consequences for readers.   \\n                The Archive now contains 136 fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of important manuscripts and series of engravings, color printed drawings, tempera paintings, water color drawings, including 90 copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated books\\u2014all in the context of full bibliographic information about each work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and extensive bibliographies.   \\n                As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees.

The evolution of any one design can be traced via links presented under Related Works in the Archive on the pull-down menus, lower left on the main viewing page for each work. \\n                In October 1805, Blake was commissioned by the engraver and would-be publisher Robert H. Cromek to prepare forty drawings illustrating Robert Blair's , a popular \\\"Graveyard\\\" school poem first published in 1743.  Cromek originally planned to select twenty of these designs for a deluxe edition of the poem.  Blake launched into the project with great enthusiasm, rapidly sketching out his illustrations in pencil, developing some into wash drawings, and then producing a group of more finished water colors for presentation to Cromek.  In a first prospectus of November 1805, Cromek names Blake as both the designer and engraver of fifteen designs.  Blake etched one image, , in white-line, but Cromek rejected it.  The dark power of the print appeals to modern tastes, but was far from fashionable in the early nineteenth century.  In a second prospectus, also of November 1805, Cromek announced that Louis Schiavonetti would engrave twelve designs for the new edition.  Blake had lost the potentially lucrative commission to engrave his own designs; his relationship with Cromek descended into anger and argument.  In spite of their disagreement, Cromek included a portrait of Blake as a frontispiece to the volume, published in 1808.  Cromek promoted the book aggressively and the illustrations to  became Blake's best known work through much of the nineteenth century. \\n                As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees.

Cromek for publication in his forthcoming edition of , although only twelve were engraved by Louis Schiavonetti for the\\n                volume, published in 1808. One design, , has been known for many years, but the other nineteen\\n                water colors disappeared between their auction in 1836 and their dramatic\\n                rediscovery in 2001.

Consisting of 100 relief and white-line etchings divided into four chapters,  is his longest illuminated book, and its plates are among his largest, approximately 22.5 x 16 cm. Though dated 1804 on its title plate, it was not printed in its entirety until c. 1820. Five complete copies are extant, along with one incomplete colored copy (chapter 1 only) and three complete posthumous copies.             \\n                                    Copy E, the only complete colored copy, is magnificent. All but one plate (51, in black ink) were printed in red-orange on one side of large sheets of J. Whatman 1820 paper, elaborately finished in watercolors, pen and ink, and gold. Each impression is numbered in pen and ink in the top right corner; the first two pages have decorative borders and all the others have one thin line drawn in red-orange ink around the image, setting off each page like a miniature painting. Blake is reputed to have worked on this colored copy well into his final years, though he never found a buyer.\\n                                    Copy E, from the Paul Mellon Collection of the Yale Center for British Art, joins other copies in the Archive printed and colored in this late style:  copy O,  copy K,  copies G and I,  copy P,  copy O,  copy G, and  copies Z and AA.  copy E will eventually be joined by copy A, whose plates in part 1 are arranged differently, and by copy I, a posthumous copy, presumably printed by Frederick Tatham, who inherited all of Blake's plates and art works, including  copy E, after Blake's wife Catherine died.\\n                                    As recipients of our Archive Updates are well aware, we have been working on  copy E for several years. The challenges presented by its scope and difficulty made it an attractive laboratory, in effect, for experiments in editorial method. Many of the adjustments in protocols and processes that arose as solutions to the problems of creating an electronic edition of  have already been introduced into other works we have published in the meantime. These include significant alterations in transcription, display, editorial notation, even in line numbering. We also took the opportunity to rescan all of our first generation 4 x 5 inch color transparencies at higher resolution on better equipment, producing digital images of exceptional fidelity and beauty that capture even the texture of the paper. This rescanning and color-correcting process took over two years.\\n                                    The Archive now contains at least one copy of each of Blake's 19 illuminated books, and in most cases includes copies from each of the printings of the books, for a current total of 49 copies, all fully searchable. In addition to the books, the Archive includes the engraved , generally considered Blake's masterpiece in traditional line engraving and the culmination of his long pictorial engagement with the Book of Job. His first series of 19 watercolors illustrating Job (commissioned c. 1805-06 by his chief patron, Thomas Butts) are available in the Archive in Preview, our mode of presentation that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (our image annotation program). Also in Preview are Blake's illustrations to Milton's \\\"L'Allegro\\\" and \\\"Il Penseroso.\\\" Also forthcoming this year are Blake's engraved designs for Robert Blair's , Edward Young's , and the Job pencil sketches, along with an illustrated Blake biography and glossary and never-before-reproduced copies of illuminated books.\\n                                    As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees.

The evolution of any one design can be traced via links presented under Related Works in the Archive on the pull-down menus, lower left on the main viewing page for each work. \\n                In October 1805, Blake was commissioned by the engraver and would-be publisher Robert H. Cromek to prepare forty drawings illustrating Robert Blair's , a popular \\\"Graveyard\\\" school poem first published in 1743.  Cromek originally planned to select twenty of these designs for a deluxe edition of the poem.  Blake launched into the project with great enthusiasm, rapidly sketching out his illustrations in pencil, developing some into wash drawings, and then producing a group of more finished water colors for presentation to Cromek.  In a first prospectus of November 1805, Cromek names Blake as both the designer and engraver of fifteen designs.  Blake etched one image, , in white-line, but Cromek rejected it.  The dark power of the print appeals to modern tastes, but was far from fashionable in the early nineteenth century.  In a second prospectus, also of November 1805, Cromek announced that Louis Schiavonetti would engrave twelve designs for the new edition.  Blake had lost the potentially lucrative commission to engrave his own designs; his relationship with Cromek descended into anger and argument.  In spite of their disagreement, Cromek included a portrait of Blake as a frontispiece to the volume, published in 1808.  Cromek promoted the book aggressively and the illustrations to  became Blake's best known work through much of the nineteenth century. \\n                As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees.

In a first prospectus of November 1805, Cromek names Blake as both the designer and engraver of fifteen designs.  Blake etched one image, , in white-line, but Cromek rejected it.  The dark power of the print appeals to modern tastes, but was far from fashionable in the early nineteenth century.  In a second prospectus, also of November 1805, Cromek announced that Louis Schiavonetti would engrave twelve designs for the new edition.  Blake had lost the potentially lucrative commission to engrave his own designs; his relationship with Cromek descended into anger and argument.

The evolution of any one design can be traced via links presented under Related Works in the Archive on the pull-down menus, lower left on the main viewing page for each work. \\n                In October 1805, Blake was commissioned by the engraver and would-be publisher Robert H. Cromek to prepare forty drawings illustrating Robert Blair's , a popular \\\"Graveyard\\\" school poem first published in 1743.  Cromek originally planned to select twenty of these designs for a deluxe edition of the poem.  Blake launched into the project with great enthusiasm, rapidly sketching out his illustrations in pencil, developing some into wash drawings, and then producing a group of more finished water colors for presentation to Cromek.  In a first prospectus of November 1805, Cromek names Blake as both the designer and engraver of fifteen designs.  Blake etched one image, , in white-line, but Cromek rejected it.  The dark power of the print appeals to modern tastes, but was far from fashionable in the early nineteenth century.  In a second prospectus, also of November 1805, Cromek announced that Louis Schiavonetti would engrave twelve designs for the new edition.  Blake had lost the potentially lucrative commission to engrave his own designs; his relationship with Cromek descended into anger and argument.

The evolution of any one design can be traced via links presented under Related Works in the Archive on the pull-down menus, lower left on the main viewing page for each work. \\n                In October 1805, Blake was commissioned by the engraver and would-be publisher Robert H. Cromek to prepare forty drawings illustrating Robert Blair's , a popular \\\"Graveyard\\\" school poem first published in 1743.  Cromek originally planned to select twenty of these designs for a deluxe edition of the poem.  Blake launched into the project with great enthusiasm, rapidly sketching out his illustrations in pencil, developing some into wash drawings, and then producing a group of more finished water colors for presentation to Cromek.  In a first prospectus of November 1805, Cromek names Blake as both the designer and engraver of fifteen designs.  Blake etched one image, , in white-line, but Cromek rejected it.  The dark power of the print appeals to modern tastes, but was far from fashionable in the early nineteenth century.  In a second prospectus, also of November 1805, Cromek announced that Louis Schiavonetti would engrave twelve designs for the new edition.  Blake had lost the potentially lucrative commission to engrave his own designs; his relationship with Cromek descended into anger and argument.  In spite of their disagreement, Cromek included a portrait of Blake as a frontispiece to the volume, published in 1808.  Cromek promoted the book aggressively and the illustrations to  became Blake's best known work through much of the nineteenth century. \\n                As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees.

Among his many and complex responses to that text are water color drawings.  The present group of 20 is selected from a sequence of about 80 biblical water colors of similar size Blake painted for Thomas Butts between c. 1800 and 1805.  These designs emphasize interactions between the human and the divine.  In works such as  and , the interaction is revelatory or redemptive.  In other designs, including , the relationship between God and humankind devolves into punishment and destruction.\\n            \\n            This group of 20 water colors is the first installment in our publication of a large selection of Blake\\u2019s water color drawings illustrating the Bible.  In coming months we will publish a group of New Testament illustrations also from the series executed for Butts.  Later we will add early works, such as , datable to c. 1780, and continue through Blake\\u2019s final biblical water colors, including  of c. 1824.\\n            \\n            As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees.
