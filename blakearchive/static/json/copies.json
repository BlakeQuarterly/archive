These three series were previously published in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake\\u2019s images).  With this republication, those functions now become available, along with our new Related Works feature giving access to related materials through active links on the work index pages and the Show Me menu on the object view pages.  Blake\\u2019s  engravings have been previously published with Image Search and Inote capabilities.  \\n            \\n            With this republication, the Archive now includes fully searchable reproductions of all four series of  designs, among Blake\\u2019s greatest achievements as a visual artist.  Thus, characters pictured in the designs, such as Bildad, Eliphaz, and of course Job\\u2019s wife, can be searched and located in all four series.  The Archive\\u2019s Image Search menu also includes a great many lesser motifs, figure types, postures and gestures.  In coming months, we will publish similarly updated versions of other works presently in Preview mode, including Blake\\u2019s nine series of water colors illustrating the poetry of John Milton.\\n            \\n            The Archive recently added a new set of scholarly tools that should prove particularly useful when studying Blake\\u2019s  designs.  These tools, known collectively as our Related Works system, are designed to show relationships among works and individual objects in the Archive. They function at two levels.  First, work index pages now include active links to related materials in the Archive.  Thus, researchers can move easily from any given  series to any other series.  Second, the Show Me menu on object view pages now includes Related Works in the Archive.  Like the work-level menu, this list includes active links to related designs and is meant to allow study of the related materials side by side.  For example, researchers can move quickly from Blake\\u2019s engraving of Behemoth and Leviathan to its drawing in the sketchbook and study how Blake developed his design from preliminary sketch to finished engraving.\\n            \\n            As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees.

These were created on commission for Blake's major patron, Thomas Butts, as a series of nineteen water colors c. 1805-06; two further designs were added to the group at a later date, probably c. 1821-27. While Blake had drawn and engraved some important designs based on Job in earlier years, the Butts set of water colors is his first attempt to create a pictorial narrative of the whole story, from what Blake believed to be Job's misapprehensions about God, through Job's torments at the hands of Satan, to the restoration of Job's physical and spiritual wellbeing. The later set of Job water colors that Blake executed for John Linnell and the famous engraved series were both based on this earlier, Butts group.\\n            The release of Blake's Job water colors is particularly significant because it marks our first publication of Blake's \\\"Non-Illuminated Works.\\\" This new \\\"wing\\\" of the Archive will gradually be populated with Blake engravings, paintings, drawings, manuscripts, and typographic editions. In the near future, we will add such important works as the Job engravings and water color illustrations to the poetry of John Milton, Thomas Gray, and Edward Young.\\n            In the interest of publishing the greatest number of high-quality images in the shortest span of time, we are introducing to the Archive a new \\\"Preview mode.\\\" Like the current presentation of Blake's illuminated books in the Archive, works in Preview will be in full and accurate color, with enlargements, and with searchable transcriptions of any texts, including even the briefest of inscriptions. The only functions that will not be available in Preview are image search and Inote. Thus, works in Preview will not offer descriptions of visual motifs, nor will those visual motifs be searchable. The advantage of this slightly reduced mode of display is that we will be able to add works to the Archive more expeditiously. All works in Preview will bear a clear indication that they are indeed in \\\"Preview,\\\" both in all relevant tables of contents and on the basic Object View page. As we add many works in Preview, we will gradually shift them toward fully functional displays that will make image search and Inote available. The Job water colors announced here are currently available in Preview mode.\\n            At present the Archive contains, in addition to the Job water colors in Preview, 41 copies of 18 of Blake's 19 illuminated books, plus a fully SGML-encoded electronic edition of David V. Erdman's . In the near future we expect to release more drawings and prints in Preview; a much-anticipated electronic edition of  Copy E, fully encoded for image search and Inote; and a collection of handlists for each of the Archive's contributing institutions as well as improved, searchable versions of our bibliographies. Future supplementary materials include a biography and glossary.\\n            As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible through the continuing support of the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, by a major grant from the Preservation and Access Division of the National Endowment for the Humanities, by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to represent works from their collections in the Archive.\"}, \"notesstmt\": null}, \"userestrict\": {\"date\": {\"#text\": \"2002\"}, \"lb\": [null, null], \"#text\": \"Copyright \\u00a9  by Morris Eaves, Robert N.

These three series were previously published in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (which provides detailed descriptions of Blake\\u2019s images).  With this republication, those functions now become available, along with our new Related Works feature giving access to related materials through active links on the work index pages and the Show Me menu on the object view pages.  Blake\\u2019s  engravings have been previously published with Image Search and Inote capabilities.  \\n            \\n            With this republication, the Archive now includes fully searchable reproductions of all four series of  designs, among Blake\\u2019s greatest achievements as a visual artist.  Thus, characters pictured in the designs, such as Bildad, Eliphaz, and of course Job\\u2019s wife, can be searched and located in all four series.  The Archive\\u2019s Image Search menu also includes a great many lesser motifs, figure types, postures and gestures.  In coming months, we will publish similarly updated versions of other works presently in Preview mode, including Blake\\u2019s nine series of water colors illustrating the poetry of John Milton.\\n            \\n            The Archive recently added a new set of scholarly tools that should prove particularly useful when studying Blake\\u2019s  designs.  These tools, known collectively as our Related Works system, are designed to show relationships among works and individual objects in the Archive. They function at two levels.  First, work index pages now include active links to related materials in the Archive.  Thus, researchers can move easily from any given  series to any other series.  Second, the Show Me menu on object view pages now includes Related Works in the Archive.  Like the work-level menu, this list includes active links to related designs and is meant to allow study of the related materials side by side.  For example, researchers can move quickly from Blake\\u2019s engraving of Behemoth and Leviathan to its drawing in the sketchbook and study how Blake developed his design from preliminary sketch to finished engraving.\\n            \\n            As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees.

The sketchbook is reproduced complete and in color for the first time. These two important sets of Job illustrations join the Butts set of water colors and the engravings, both previously published in the Archive. Thus, the Archive now includes all four series of Job illustrations. The engravings are fully searchable. The Linnell set of water colors and the sketchbook are presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (our image annotation program).\\n            Blake's pictorial engagements with The Book of Job extended over many decades. His first efforts were a small group of wash drawings of the mid-1780s showing Job in his misery with his wife and three friends. Another version of this subject appears among the emblem series that Blake sketched in his Notebook, but the composition appearing in the wash drawings culminated in the large intaglio etching/engraving, \\\"Job,\\\" which Blake listed in his advertisement  of 10 October 1793. This print may have stimulated Blake's chief patron, Thomas Butts, to commission a tempera painting, , c. 1799-1800 and, about six years later, a series of nineteen water colors illustrating the story of Job (the so-called \\\"Butts set\\\"). In 1821, Blake and his new patron John Linnell borrowed the water colors from Butts. Linnell traced the series and Blake colored them (the so-called \\\"Linnell set\\\"). Blake also added two more compositions to this later group and added versions of these same compositions to the earlier group, so that both sets now have twenty-one designs. The Linnell set led directly to his commission for the engravings. These began as a series of reduced sketches executed in 1823; the engravings themselves, with a title page added, were not finished and published until 1826.\\n            As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees. The site is made possible through the continuing support of the Library of Congress, the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and by the cooperation of the international array of libraries and museums that have generously given us permission to reproduce works from their collections in the Archive.\"}, \"notesstmt\": null}, \"userestrict\": {\"date\": {\"#text\": \"2006\"}, \"#text\": \"Copyright \\u00a9  by Morris Eaves, Robert N.

His first efforts were a small group of wash drawings of the mid-1780s showing Job in his misery with his wife and three friends. Another version of this subject appears among the emblem series that Blake sketched in his Notebook, but the composition appearing in the wash drawings culminated in the large intaglio etching/engraving, \\\"Job,\\\" which Blake listed in his advertisement  of 10 October 1793. This print may have stimulated Blake's chief patron, Thomas Butts, to commission a tempera painting, , c. 1799-1800 and, about six years later, a series of nineteen water colors illustrating the story of Job (the so-called \\\"Butts set\\\"). In 1821, Blake and his new patron John Linnell borrowed the water colors from Butts. Linnell traced the series and Blake colored them (the so-called \\\"Linnell set\\\"). Blake also added two more compositions to this later group and added versions of these same compositions to the earlier group, so that both sets now have twenty-one designs. The Linnell set led directly to his commission for the engravings. These began as a series of reduced sketches executed in 1823; the engravings themselves, with a title page added, were not finished and published until 1826.\\n      As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees.

This work is generally considered Blake's masterpiece in traditional line engraving, as well as the culmination of his long pictorial engagement with the Book of Job. His first series of 19 water colors illustrating Job were commissioned c. 1805-06 by his chief patron, Thomas Butts. These are available in the Archive in Preview (see description below). In 1821, Blake and his new patron John Linnell borrowed this Butts set of designs. Linnell traced the series and Blake colored them. Blake also added two more compositions to this later group and added versions of these same compositions to the earlier series, so that both sets now have 21 designs. The Linnell set led directly to his commissioning of the engravings, as set forth in a contract dated 25 March 1823. Blake began the project by executing a series of 21 reduced pencil sketches of the central designs for transfer to the copperplates. According to John Linnell, the border designs, unique to the engraved series, were a last-minute addition. Blake also added a title page, perhaps late in the production process. Although 21 of the plates bear 1825 imprints (the second plate was mistakenly dated 1828), Linnell's account books show that the engravings were not published until March 1826.\\n            The copy reproduced in the Archive is from the first printing on laid India paper with the word Proof appearing lower right on all but the title page. Also included, as the first item, is a copy of the original letterpress cover label for the Job engravings. Our complete transcription of all engraved texts on each plate is the first to be published in any form. Both these inscribed texts and the designs are fully searchable.\\n            At present the Archive contains 48 copies of 18 of Blake's 19 illuminated books, all fully searchable. In addition to the Butts set of Job designs, Blake's illustrations to Milton's \\\"L'Allegro\\\" and \\\"Il Penseroso\\\" are also available in Preview, our mode of presentation that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (our image annotation program).

Cromek originally planned to select twenty of these designs for a deluxe edition of the poem.  Blake launched into the project with great enthusiasm, rapidly sketching out his illustrations in pencil, developing some into wash drawings, and then producing a group of more finished water colors for presentation to Cromek.  In a first prospectus of November 1805, Cromek names Blake as both the designer and engraver of fifteen designs.  Blake etched one image, , in white-line, but Cromek rejected it.  The dark power of the print appeals to modern tastes, but was far from fashionable in the early nineteenth century.  In a second prospectus, also of November 1805, Cromek announced that Louis Schiavonetti would engrave twelve designs for the new edition.  Blake had lost the potentially lucrative commission to engrave his own designs; his relationship with Cromek descended into anger and argument.  In spite of their disagreement, Cromek included a portrait of Blake as a frontispiece to the volume, published in 1808.  Cromek promoted the book aggressively and the illustrations to  became Blake's best known work through much of the nineteenth century. \\n                As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees.

They are:  Copy G,  Copy A,  Copy A,  Copy B,  Copy A,  Copy E, and  Copy F.\\n            We had announced  Copy G as forthcoming two months ago, but formatting the double-columned text diplomatically in SGML for both Netscape and Internet Explorer proved more taxing and time consuming than anticipated. Such are the joys and tribulations of electronic publishing. Solving the problems there, though, ensured diplomatic transcriptions for Blake's other books with double-columned texts,  and . Together, these three works are often referred to as Blake's Bible of Hell or, simply, the Urizen books. , of which there are only seven extant copies, was first produced in 1794, color printed to form Copies A, C, D, E (untraced), F, and J. It was printed again in 1795 to form Copy B, which was produced as part of a set of illuminated books printed on large paper, and then one last time in c. 1818 to form Copy G, which was produced in Blake's late printing and coloring style. The editors are currently working on Copies A, B, C, and F and expect to have them in the Archive by the end of the year.  and  exist in unique copies, with only a few proof impressions extant. They were printed in 1795 and executed in intaglio instead of in relief etching, the technique Blake normally used for his illuminated books. Although their texts are printed in intaglio, their frontispieces are beautifully color printed from the surface of the plates.\\n            With , which consists of two parts entitled \\\"Africa\\\" and \\\"Asia,\\\" we complete Blake's other series of illuminated books, sometimes known as the Continental Prophecies, begun in 1793 with  and continued in 1794 with . The copy of  included here is one of six extant; all were color printed in the same printing session in 1795.\\n            With fourteen complete copies extant,  is not as rare as these other illuminated books, but Copy A, which was printed and colored in 1795 as part of Blake's large-paper set of books, is, along with Copies K, O, and M, one of only four colored copies\\u2014and it was the model for Copy K. Moreover, only it and Copy O have the last four lines on plate 4, which was masked in the printing of the other copies. The Archive will include Copies M and O (c. 1807 and 1818) later this year.\\n            Only nine copies of  are extant, and only two of those, Copies H and O (1795 and 1818), have plate 3, the Preludium. The Archive will include both of these copies by the end of the year. Copy E, included here, was lightly color printed on both sides of the paper in 1794 and joins Copy B, color printed more heavily on one side of the paper the same year. Copy F is an exquisitely beautiful copy, heavily color printed (especially its frontispiece) in c. 1794, and never before reproduced. It joins Copies C and J (both 1793), and will be joined later this year by Copies G and P (1795 and 1818).\\n            All of these editions have newly edited texts; all images in the editions were scanned from either 4x5 or 8x10 transparencies, nearly all of which were made specifically for the Archive. Like our other editions, these are all SGML-encoded, fully searchable for both text and images and supported by the unique Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates.\\n            The Archive now contains sixteen copies of ten illuminated books. In the coming months, we will be adding copies of , , , , and , along with copies of books already in the Archive but from different printings. Our goal is to have the entire illuminated canon online this year. In addition, work continues on the SGML edition of David V.

We are presenting two versions of these plates, one with the designs uncolored and one with the designs hand colored. \\n                , extant in eighteen complete copies, consists of eleven relief-etched plates executed and first printed in 1793. Copy H was produced in Blake's first printing session and joins copies a, A, B, C, E, I, and J (1793), F (c. 1794), G (1795), and O and P (c. 1818), previously published in the Archive. Probably to lend variety to his stock of copies on hand, Blake used three ink colors in this first printing: yellow ochre (as in Copy A), raw sienna (Copies B, C, and E), and green (Copies H, I, and J). Like all early copies of , Copy H has the frontispiece printed on one side of a leaf, but all other plates are printed on both sides of five leaves. In Copy H, the embossments of the platemarks into the leaves can be seen from both sides of the leaves. Examples of the full leaves for plates 2 and 10, included as Supplemental Views in the Show Me menu, lower left under the plate images, show how the plates were registered to the leaves. \\n                \\n                Blake began work on the Stedman plates in 1791. Stedman visited Blake in June 1794 and subsequently the engraver helped the author with various business matters, very probably including negotiations with the book's publisher, Joseph Johnson. Blake's attitudes towards slavery and colonialism were indebted to Stedman's autobiographical narrative, as is particularly evident in the texts and designs of his illuminated books  and , both dated 1793. Stedman's relationship with a female slave, Joanna, may have influenced Blake's complex representations of gender and sexuality.\\n                \\n                With the publication of  Copy H, the Archive now contains fully searchable and scalable electronic editions of 87 copies of Blake's nineteen illuminated books in the context of full bibliographic information about each work, careful diplomatic transcriptions of all texts, detailed descriptions of all images, and extensive bibliographies. New protocols for transcription, which produce improved accuracy and fuller documentation in editors' notes, have been applied to all copies of  in the Archive. With the Archive's Compare feature, users can easily juxtapose multiple impressions of any plate across the different copies of this or any of the other illuminated books and, with the Virtual Lightbox, users can examine images from any genre side by side, as well as crop, zoom, and juxtapose them for close study.               \\n                \\n                In addition to illuminated books, the Archive contains many important manuscripts and series of engravings, sketches, and water color drawings, including illustrations to Thomas Gray's , water color and engraved illustrations to Dante's , the large color printed drawings of 1795 and c. 1805, the Linnell and Butts sets of the  water colors and the sketchbook containing drawings for the engraved illustrations to the , the water color illustrations to Robert Blair's , and all nine of Blake's water color series illustrating the poetry of John Milton.\\n                \\n                As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees.

We are presenting two versions of these plates, one with the designs uncolored and one with the designs hand colored.  These commercial copy engravings are presented in our Preview mode, one that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (our image annotation program).           \\n                Stedman's  contains a frontispiece to volume 1, an engraved vignette on the title page of each of the two volumes, and eighty numbered full-page plates (including three maps).  Thirteen of the numbered plates are signed by Blake; a further three unsigned plates (7, 12, and 14) have been attributed to Blake by modern scholars.  As both title pages indicate, the full-page plates are based on drawings by Stedman.  None of the drawings on which Blake based his engravings has been traced, but it is likely that Blake made various minor alterations in Stedman's amateur designs.               \\n                Blake began work on the Stedman plates in 1791.  Stedman visited Blake in June 1794, and subsequently the engraver helped the author with various business matters, very probably including negotiations with the book's publisher, Joseph Johnson.  Blake's attitudes towards slavery and colonialism were indebted to Stedman's autobiographical narrative, as is particularly evident in the texts and designs of his illuminated books  and , both dated 1793.  Stedman's relationship with a female slave, Joanna, may have influenced Blake's complex representations of gender and sexuality.                  \\n                Most, possibly all, of the large-paper copies issued in 1796 have hand-colored plates that include touches of liquefied gold and silver.  This tinting was very probably executed by anonymous commercial colorists hired by Johnson.  A second edition was issued in 1806 and reprinted in 1813.  Some copies of these two later issues also have hand-colored plates, but in a style different from the 1796 coloring.\\n                \\n                As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees.

Consisting of 100 relief and white-line etchings divided into four chapters,  is his longest illuminated book, and its plates are among his largest, approximately 22.5 x 16 cm. Though dated 1804 on its title plate, it was not printed in its entirety until c. 1820. Five complete copies are extant, along with one incomplete colored copy (chapter 1 only) and three complete posthumous copies.             \\n                                    Copy E, the only complete colored copy, is magnificent. All but one plate (51, in black ink) were printed in red-orange on one side of large sheets of J. Whatman 1820 paper, elaborately finished in watercolors, pen and ink, and gold. Each impression is numbered in pen and ink in the top right corner; the first two pages have decorative borders and all the others have one thin line drawn in red-orange ink around the image, setting off each page like a miniature painting. Blake is reputed to have worked on this colored copy well into his final years, though he never found a buyer.\\n                                    Copy E, from the Paul Mellon Collection of the Yale Center for British Art, joins other copies in the Archive printed and colored in this late style:  Copy O,  Copy K,  Copies G and I,  Copy P,  Copy O,  Copy G, and  Copies Z and AA.  Copy E will eventually be joined by Copy A, whose plates in part 1 are arranged differently, and by Copy I, a posthumous copy, presumably printed by Frederick Tatham, who inherited all of Blake's plates and art works, including  Copy E, after Blake's wife Catherine died.\\n                                    As recipients of our Archive Updates are well aware, we have been working on  Copy E for several years. The challenges presented by its scope and difficulty made it an attractive laboratory, in effect, for experiments in editorial method. Many of the adjustments in protocols and processes that arose as solutions to the problems of creating an electronic edition of  have already been introduced into other works we have published in the meantime. These include significant alterations in transcription, display, editorial notation, even in line numbering. We also took the opportunity to rescan all of our first generation 4 x 5 inch color transparencies at higher resolution on better equipment, producing digital images of exceptional fidelity and beauty that capture even the texture of the paper. This rescanning and color-correcting process took over two years.\\n                                    The Archive now contains at least one copy of each of Blake's 19 illuminated books, and in most cases includes copies from each of the printings of the books, for a current total of 49 copies, all fully searchable. In addition to the books, the Archive includes the engraved , generally considered Blake's masterpiece in traditional line engraving and the culmination of his long pictorial engagement with the Book of Job. His first series of 19 watercolors illustrating Job (commissioned c. 1805-06 by his chief patron, Thomas Butts) are available in the Archive in Preview, our mode of presentation that provides all the features of the Archive except Image Search and Inote (our image annotation program). Also in Preview are Blake's illustrations to Milton's \\\"L'Allegro\\\" and \\\"Il Penseroso.\\\" Also forthcoming this year are Blake's engraved designs for Robert Blair's , Edward Young's , and the Job pencil sketches, along with an illustrated Blake biography and glossary and never-before-reproduced copies of illuminated books.\\n                                    As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees.

The evolution of any one design can be traced via links presented under Related Works in the Archive on the pull-down menus, lower left on the main viewing page for each work. \\n                In October 1805, Blake was commissioned by the engraver and would-be publisher Robert H. Cromek to prepare forty drawings illustrating Robert Blair's , a popular \\\"Graveyard\\\" school poem first published in 1743.  Cromek originally planned to select twenty of these designs for a deluxe edition of the poem.  Blake launched into the project with great enthusiasm, rapidly sketching out his illustrations in pencil, developing some into wash drawings, and then producing a group of more finished water colors for presentation to Cromek.  In a first prospectus of November 1805, Cromek names Blake as both the designer and engraver of fifteen designs.  Blake etched one image, , in white-line, but Cromek rejected it.  The dark power of the print appeals to modern tastes, but was far from fashionable in the early nineteenth century.  In a second prospectus, also of November 1805, Cromek announced that Louis Schiavonetti would engrave twelve designs for the new edition.  Blake had lost the potentially lucrative commission to engrave his own designs; his relationship with Cromek descended into anger and argument.  In spite of their disagreement, Cromek included a portrait of Blake as a frontispiece to the volume, published in 1808.  Cromek promoted the book aggressively and the illustrations to  became Blake's best known work through much of the nineteenth century. \\n                As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees.

Cromek hired Blake to illustrate Blair's popular\\n                \\\"Graveyard\\\" poem in 1805. Blake produced one design, ,\\n                as a white-line etching, but Cromek found this so unsatisfactory that he quickly\\n                turned to the fashionable engraver Louis Schiavonetti to etch and engrave twelve of\\n                Blake's illustrations.

They are:  Copy A,  Copies B, C, G, and L, and  Copy C.\\n            Composed and executed in 1788,  and  are Blake's first works in illuminated printing, though no copy of either work survives from this date. The ten plates of  were followed quickly by twenty  plates in two antithetical sets (a and b series). Only one copy of  is extant, now in the Huntington Library, printed c. 1795 with and in the same style as  Copy L, the only copy consisting exclusively of the ten b-series of plates, now in The Pierpont Morgan Library. The other twelve recorded copies of this book consist of a mixture of the same eight to twelve plates, which appeared to be merely incomplete sets of proofs until it was discovered that six of these copies were 19th-century reproductions. Once the inauthentic impressions were weeded out, it became apparent that what remained was Blake's selection of a and b plates for an abridged version of the work printed around 1794. We present Copies B, C, and G of this twelve-plate work, now in the collections of the Yale Center for British Art, Library of Congress, and The Pierpont Morgan Library, respectively.\\n            There are only four copies of , Blake's most personal epic. Copy C, from the New York Public Library, was Blake's own copy. Printed c. 1811, it was later reconfigured and renumbered by Blake when he inserted extra plates, which he appears to have done on at least two different occasions.\\n            All of these editions have newly edited texts and are all fully searchable for both text and images and supported by the unique Inote and ImageSizer applications described in our previous updates.\\n            We now have twenty-two copies of thirteen illuminated books. Over this and next year, we will be adding Blake's last illuminated works, , , and , as well as  Copy D and  Copy E. We will also be adding at least six more copies of , two copies of , five copies of , four copies of , and two copies each of  and . In addition, work continues on the SGML edition of David V. Erdman's .\\n            We will continue to post updates on various lists every few months, but readers interested in the progress of the Archive can subscribe to our Blake Update list, which can be found on the Archive's Contents Page. On this page readers will also find that we have opened the top level of the Contributing Institutions Page, which provides contact information and links to institutions participating in the Archive.

The evolution of any one design can be traced via links presented under Related Works in the Archive on the pull-down menus, lower left on the main viewing page for each work. \\n                In October 1805, Blake was commissioned by the engraver and would-be publisher Robert H. Cromek to prepare forty drawings illustrating Robert Blair's , a popular \\\"Graveyard\\\" school poem first published in 1743.  Cromek originally planned to select twenty of these designs for a deluxe edition of the poem.  Blake launched into the project with great enthusiasm, rapidly sketching out his illustrations in pencil, developing some into wash drawings, and then producing a group of more finished water colors for presentation to Cromek.  In a first prospectus of November 1805, Cromek names Blake as both the designer and engraver of fifteen designs.  Blake etched one image, , in white-line, but Cromek rejected it.  The dark power of the print appeals to modern tastes, but was far from fashionable in the early nineteenth century.  In a second prospectus, also of November 1805, Cromek announced that Louis Schiavonetti would engrave twelve designs for the new edition.  Blake had lost the potentially lucrative commission to engrave his own designs; his relationship with Cromek descended into anger and argument.  In spite of their disagreement, Cromek included a portrait of Blake as a frontispiece to the volume, published in 1808.  Cromek promoted the book aggressively and the illustrations to  became Blake's best known work through much of the nineteenth century. \\n                As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees.

The evolution of any one design can be traced via links presented under Related Works in the Archive on the pull-down menus, lower left on the main viewing page for each work. \\n                In October 1805, Blake was commissioned by the engraver and would-be publisher Robert H. Cromek to prepare forty drawings illustrating Robert Blair's , a popular \\\"Graveyard\\\" school poem first published in 1743.  Cromek originally planned to select twenty of these designs for a deluxe edition of the poem.  Blake launched into the project with great enthusiasm, rapidly sketching out his illustrations in pencil, developing some into wash drawings, and then producing a group of more finished water colors for presentation to Cromek.  In a first prospectus of November 1805, Cromek names Blake as both the designer and engraver of fifteen designs.  Blake etched one image, , in white-line, but Cromek rejected it.  The dark power of the print appeals to modern tastes, but was far from fashionable in the early nineteenth century.  In a second prospectus, also of November 1805, Cromek announced that Louis Schiavonetti would engrave twelve designs for the new edition.  Blake had lost the potentially lucrative commission to engrave his own designs; his relationship with Cromek descended into anger and argument.  In spite of their disagreement, Cromek included a portrait of Blake as a frontispiece to the volume, published in 1808.  Cromek promoted the book aggressively and the illustrations to  became Blake's best known work through much of the nineteenth century. \\n                As always, the William Blake Archive is a free site, imposing no access restrictions and charging no subscription fees.
